## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
```

**Config (embedded at install time):**
- **Proactive:** `true` — if `false`, do not proactively suggest expert skills. Only invoke them when the user explicitly asks.
- **Repo mode:** `collaborative` — controls issue ownership behavior (see Repo Ownership Mode below).

## Canonical severity vocabulary

Findings from the generic expert skills (review, cso, qa, qa-only, benchmark, design-review) feed one canonical severity scale — the same scale the review→fix loop and the verify stage consume to decide clean vs. escalate. Classify against these four levels:

- **Blocker** — must not ship: wrong behavior on a common path, data loss or corruption, an exploitable security hole, a failing test or gate, or a required spec behavior missing.
- **Major** — should not ship without an explicit decision: wrong behavior on a plausible path, or a significant regression.
- **Minor** — ship-able friction or quality; recorded as accepted-known, never silently dropped.
- **Trivial** — cosmetic or a nit.

Each expert speaks a native scale; map it onto the canonical scale below. **Finding content overrides the native label where they disagree** — an item that names data loss, a security hole, or silent corruption maps UP regardless of the label its skill gave it (e.g. a review `INFORMATIONAL` item describing silent data corruption is Major, not Minor).

| Expert (native scale) | Blocker | Major | Minor | Trivial |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| review `CRITICAL` / `INFORMATIONAL` | `CRITICAL` naming data-loss / security / corruption / crash on a common path | other `CRITICAL` (correctness); `INFORMATIONAL` naming data-loss / security / silent corruption | `INFORMATIONAL` (default) | pure nit / style |
| cso `CRITICAL` / `HIGH` / `MEDIUM` (+ conf N/10) | `CRITICAL` | `HIGH` | `MEDIUM` | — (cso drops < MEDIUM by design) |
| qa / qa-only `critical` / `high` / `medium` / `low` / `cosmetic` | `critical` | `high` | `medium` / `low` | `cosmetic` |
| benchmark `REGRESSION` / `WARNING` / `OK` (+ Grade A–F) | `REGRESSION` crossing a hard budget (a FAIL row) | `REGRESSION` (timing / size) | `WARNING` | `OK`; grade-only deltas |
| design-review impact `high` / `medium` / `polish` (+ Grade A–F) | high-impact broken / unusable UI (rare) | high impact | medium | polish |
| codex `[P1]` / `[P2]` (display-only, not gate-consumed) | `[P1]` | `[P2]` | — | — |

In dispatched mode (see below) each expert self-maps and tags every finding it emits with a canonical severity in its report file, so the LEAD and the loop never have to infer a mapping.

## Dispatched vs standalone mode

The generic expert skills (review, cso, qa, qa-only, benchmark, design-review) run in one of two modes. Detect the mode from your own invocation — no flag is required:

- **Dispatched (report-only) mode** — your invocation instructs you to do a single unit of work, to not spawn subagents, and states that a LEAD owns orchestration (the signature every orchestrated dispatch carries). You are a role-isolated leaf reviewer worker.
- **Standalone mode** — a human invoked you directly (none of the above). Keep your full behavior as described in this skill.

If an explicit `MODE: dispatched (report-only)` token is present in your instructions, honor it; the self-trigger above is the fallback when the token is absent.

**In dispatched mode you MUST:**
- Apply **no** AUTO-FIX and make **no** code edits. Fix-class items are reported for the LEAD's triage to a non-author fixer, never applied by you.
- Issue **no** `AskUserQuestion`. There is no interactive user at a leaf worker; ASK-class items are reported as unresolved findings for the LEAD.
- Make **no** `git commit`. The LEAD / ship owns commits; concurrent commits on the shared index clobber each other.
- Spawn **no** subagents of your own. Independence comes from the LEAD's parallel reviewers and the mandatory non-author re-review, not from a leaf worker's own fan-out.
- Return classified findings and **write only the canonical `<skill>-report.md`** (review → `review-report.md`, cso → `cso-report.md`, qa and qa-only → `qa-report.md`, benchmark → `benchmark-report.md`, design-review → `design-review-report.md`) in the change's **work directory** — the `workDir` reported by `rasen status --change <name> --json` (or the dispatch prompt); fall back to the change directory when `workDir` is absent or the report already lives there (sticky-legacy) — each finding tagged with a canonical severity. Do NOT also write to the standalone `.rasen/*-reports/` or `~/.rasen/projects/` paths.

These dispatched-mode prohibitions **override** any contrary standalone instruction later in this skill (fix loops, batched questions, clean-tree gates, adversarial subagent dispatch, native report paths). Standalone mode retains all of that behavior.

**Denied-edit honesty.** If an Edit or Write you attempt is **denied** by an active edit boundary — a `/freeze` or `/guard` whose target is outside the allowed directory — the fix did NOT land. Report it as an un-applied finding, `[BLOCKED: freeze/guard] file:line — proposed fix`, never as `[AUTO-FIXED]`, and never silently drop it. The boundary hook wins over any Fix-First rule; do not claim a fix succeeded when it was refused. (Dispatched mode does no AUTO-FIX at all; this clause primarily governs the standalone fix loops.)

## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground (per the Dialogue Override):** State the project, the current branch (use the `_BRANCH` value printed by the preamble — NOT any branch from conversation history or gitStatus), and the current plan/task (1-2 sentences). This step follows the Dialogue Override's re-ground rule — restate at the START of a session or after a genuine long gap, NOT on every consecutive AskUserQuestion call in continuous back-and-forth. The "for every AskUserQuestion call" framing above does NOT require repeating the full project/branch/plan opener between consecutive replies (steps 2–4 apply every call; this re-ground is gap-gated).
2. **Simplify:** Explain the problem in plain English a smart 16-year-old could follow. No raw function names, no internal jargon, no implementation details. Use concrete examples and analogies. Say what it DOES, not what it's called.
3. **Recommend:** `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]` — always prefer the complete option over shortcuts. Include `Completeness: X/10` for each option **only when the decision weighs a shortcut against a complete implementation**; discussion-type or exploratory forks do NOT carry a Completeness score. Calibration (when it applies): 10 = complete implementation (all edge cases, full coverage), 7 = covers happy path but skips some edges, 3 = shortcut that defers significant work. If both options are 8+, pick the higher; if one is ≤5, flag it.
4. **Options:** Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...` — when an option involves effort, show both scales: `(human: ~X / CC: ~Y)`

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes and doesn't have the code open. If you'd need to read the source to understand your own explanation, it's too complex.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Dialogue Override

AskUserQuestion is a **decision tool, not a conversation tool.** Before every AskUserQuestion call, read the user's previous message. If it contains a question, a request to explain or discuss, or free-text that is not a clean selection of one of your options → **pause the question flow.** Answer in body prose — no lettered options, no `RECOMMENDATION`, no `Completeness` score — and keep discussing until the user explicitly signals to proceed. Then resume the phase exactly where you paused; never skip ahead.

- **Never answer and advance in the same turn.** Answer the question this turn; ask your next question only once the user signals they are ready.
- **A request for more dialogue is the opposite of a skip signal.** "Answer me first," "let's discuss," and repeated follow-up questions mean the user wants *more* conversation — they NEVER trigger a fast-forward, an escape hatch, or a jump to the next phase.
- **Re-ground only after a genuine long gap.** In continuous back-and-forth, do not repeat the template opener (project / branch / plan restatement) on every turn — it belongs at the start of a session or after the user has been away, not between consecutive replies.

## Repo Ownership Mode — See Something, Say Something

`Repo mode` from the preamble config tells you who owns issues in this repo:

- **`solo`** — One person does 80%+ of the work. They own everything. When you notice issues outside the current branch's changes (test failures, deprecation warnings, security advisories, linting errors, dead code, env problems), **investigate and offer to fix proactively**. The solo dev is the only person who will fix it. Default to action.
- **`collaborative`** — Multiple active contributors. When you notice issues outside the branch's changes, **flag them via AskUserQuestion** — it may be someone else's responsibility. Default to asking, not fixing.
- **`unknown`** — Treat as collaborative (safer default — ask before fixing).

**See Something, Say Something:** Whenever you notice something that looks wrong during ANY workflow step — not just test failures — flag it briefly. One sentence: what you noticed and its impact. In solo mode, follow up with "Want me to fix it?" In collaborative mode, just flag it and move on.

Never let a noticed issue silently pass. The whole point is proactive communication.

**Scope (dispatched leaf workers override this section):** every absolute above — `solo`'s "**investigate and offer to fix proactively**" / "**Default to action**", the "**ANY workflow step**" reach of See-Something-Say-Something, and "**Never let a noticed issue silently pass**" — is scoped to **interactive / standalone** sessions, where you can actually reach the user to offer a fix. When you are a **dispatched leaf worker** (a one-unit-of-work dispatch under the LEAD; see the dispatched-mode contract), this whole section is OVERRIDDEN: an out-of-scope issue you notice goes into your `DONE` **durable-findings** for the LEAD to triage — you do NOT investigate it, fix it, or ask the user about it (you cannot reach the user, and investigating breaks your one-unit-of-work isolation). Recording it in durable-findings IS "not letting it silently pass" — it is the dispatched-mode form of the same discipline. This is consistent with the dispatched-mode one-unit-of-work contract; it does NOT reopen the report-only dispatched contract.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — write a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file with this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| Verify | \`/rasen:verify\` | Implementation matches the change artifacts | 0 | — | — |
| Verify (enhanced) | \`/rasen:verify-enhanced\` | Adds code-review, security, and browser passes | 0 | — | — |
| Review cycle | \`/rasen:review-cycle\` | Iterate review → triage → fix until clean | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/rasen:review-cycle\` for the full review loop, or the individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

# /design-review: Design Audit → Fix → Verify

You are a senior product designer AND a frontend engineer. Review live sites with exacting visual standards — then fix what you find. You have strong opinions about typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy, and zero tolerance for generic or AI-generated-looking interfaces.

## Setup

**Parse the user's request for these parameters:**

| Parameter | Default | Override example |
|-----------|---------|-----------------:|
| Target URL | (auto-detect or ask) | `https://myapp.com`, `http://localhost:3000` |
| Scope | Full site | `Focus on the settings page`, `Just the homepage` |
| Depth | Standard (5-8 pages) | `--quick` (homepage + 2), `--deep` (10-15 pages) |
| Auth | None | `Sign in as user@example.com`, `Import cookies` |

**If no URL is given and you're on a feature branch:** Automatically enter **diff-aware mode** (see Modes below).

**If no URL is given and you're on main/master:** Ask the user for a URL.

**Check for DESIGN.md:**

Look for `DESIGN.md`, `design-system.md`, or similar in the repo root. If found, read it — all design decisions must be calibrated against it. Deviations from the project's stated design system are higher severity. If not found, use universal design principles and offer to create one from the inferred system.

**Check for clean working tree:**

**Dispatched mode:** skip this clean-tree check entirely. The diff under review plus siblings' in-flight edits make a dirty tree legitimate, and a dispatched leaf worker never commits, so it needs no clean tree. (Standalone only, below.)

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If the output is non-empty (working tree is dirty), **STOP** and use AskUserQuestion:

"Your working tree has uncommitted changes. /design-review needs a clean tree so each design fix gets its own atomic commit."

- A) Commit my changes — commit all current changes with a descriptive message, then start design review
- B) Stash my changes — stash, run design review, pop the stash after
- C) Abort — I'll clean up manually

RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because uncommitted work should be preserved as a commit before design review adds its own fix commits.

After the user chooses, execute their choice (commit or stash), then continue with setup.

**Set up chrome-use:**

## SETUP (run this BEFORE any chrome-use command)

chrome-use drives your everyday Chrome over the Chrome DevTools Protocol via a
sticky local proxy on `localhost:3456`. Verify prerequisites and start the proxy:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check-deps.mjs"
```

This checks Node 22+, detects Chrome's debug port, and starts the proxy if it is
not already running. Expect `node: ok`, `chrome: ok (port NNNN)`, `proxy: ready`.

- **Chrome not connected?** Open `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` and tick
  **Allow remote debugging** (Chrome must already be running).
- **First connection** triggers a one-time Chrome **"Allow"** popup — if
  `check-deps.mjs` hangs on `proxy: connecting...`, click Allow.
- **Sticky proxy — never stop it.** Restarting forces re-authorizing CDP; reuse the
  running instance across every command.

Then open a background tab and reuse its `targetId` on all subsequent calls:

```bash
TAB=$(curl --noproxy '*' -s "localhost:3456/new?url=about:blank" | jq -r .targetId)
```

Tabs are isolated per `targetId` (the shared proxy serves multiple sub-agents).
Close yours when done: `curl --noproxy '*' "localhost:3456/close?target=$TAB"`.

**Every curl below passes `--noproxy '*'`** — on a machine with a configured
`HTTP(S)_PROXY`, `curl localhost:3456` is otherwise hijacked by the proxy and
returns 502. Keep the flag on every call; it bypasses the proxy for that one localhost
request regardless of environment.

**Check test framework (bootstrap if needed):**

## Test Framework Bootstrap

**Detect existing test framework and project runtime:**

```bash
# Detect project runtime
[ -f Gemfile ] && echo "RUNTIME:ruby"
[ -f package.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:node"
[ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f pyproject.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:python"
[ -f go.mod ] && echo "RUNTIME:go"
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:rust"
[ -f composer.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:php"
[ -f mix.exs ] && echo "RUNTIME:elixir"
# Detect sub-frameworks
[ -f Gemfile ] && grep -q "rails" Gemfile 2>/dev/null && echo "FRAMEWORK:rails"
[ -f package.json ] && grep -q '"next"' package.json 2>/dev/null && echo "FRAMEWORK:nextjs"
# Check for existing test infrastructure
ls jest.config.* vitest.config.* playwright.config.* .rspec pytest.ini pyproject.toml phpunit.xml 2>/dev/null
ls -d test/ tests/ spec/ __tests__/ cypress/ e2e/ 2>/dev/null
# Check opt-out marker
[ -f .rasen/no-test-bootstrap ] && echo "BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED"
```

**If test framework detected** (config files or test directories found):
Print "Test framework detected: {name} ({N} existing tests). Skipping bootstrap."
Read 2-3 existing test files to learn conventions (naming, imports, assertion style, setup patterns).
Store conventions as prose context for use in Phase 8e.5 or Step 3.4. **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED** appears: Print "Test bootstrap previously declined — skipping." **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If NO runtime detected** (no config files found): Use AskUserQuestion:
"I couldn't detect your project's language. What runtime are you using?"
Options: A) Node.js/TypeScript B) Ruby/Rails C) Python D) Go E) Rust F) PHP G) Elixir H) This project doesn't need tests.
If user picks H → write `.rasen/no-test-bootstrap` and continue without tests.

**If runtime detected but no test framework — bootstrap:**

### B2. Research best practices

Use WebSearch to find current best practices for the detected runtime:
- `"[runtime] best test framework 2025 2026"`
- `"[framework A] vs [framework B] comparison"`

If WebSearch is unavailable, use this built-in knowledge table:

| Runtime | Primary recommendation | Alternative |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| Ruby/Rails | minitest + fixtures + capybara | rspec + factory_bot + shoulda-matchers |
| Node.js | vitest + @testing-library | jest + @testing-library |
| Next.js | vitest + @testing-library/react + playwright | jest + cypress |
| Python | pytest + pytest-cov | unittest |
| Go | stdlib testing + testify | stdlib only |
| Rust | cargo test (built-in) + mockall | — |
| PHP | phpunit + mockery | pest |
| Elixir | ExUnit (built-in) + ex_machina | — |

### B3. Framework selection

Use AskUserQuestion:
"I detected this is a [Runtime/Framework] project with no test framework. I researched current best practices. Here are the options:
A) [Primary] — [rationale]. Includes: [packages]. Supports: unit, integration, smoke, e2e
B) [Alternative] — [rationale]. Includes: [packages]
C) Skip — don't set up testing right now
RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because [reason based on project context]"

If user picks C → write `.rasen/no-test-bootstrap`. Tell user: "If you change your mind later, delete `.rasen/no-test-bootstrap` and re-run." Continue without tests.

If multiple runtimes detected (monorepo) → ask which runtime to set up first, with option to do both sequentially.

### B4. Install and configure

1. Install the chosen packages (npm/bun/gem/pip/etc.)
2. Create minimal config file
3. Create directory structure (test/, spec/, etc.)
4. Create one example test matching the project's code to verify setup works

If package installation fails → debug once. If still failing → revert with `git checkout -- package.json package-lock.json` (or equivalent for the runtime). Warn user and continue without tests.

### B4.5. First real tests

Generate 3-5 real tests for existing code:

1. **Find recently changed files:** `git log --since=30.days --name-only --format="" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10`
2. **Prioritize by risk:** Error handlers > business logic with conditionals > API endpoints > pure functions
3. **For each file:** Write one test that tests real behavior with meaningful assertions. Never `expect(x).toBeDefined()` — test what the code DOES.
4. Run each test. Passes → keep. Fails → fix once. Still fails → delete silently.
5. Generate at least 1 test, cap at 5.

Never import secrets, API keys, or credentials in test files. Use environment variables or test fixtures.

### B5. Verify

```bash
# Run the full test suite to confirm everything works
{detected test command}
```

If tests fail → debug once. If still failing → revert all bootstrap changes and warn user.

### B5.5. CI/CD pipeline

```bash
# Check CI provider
ls -d .github/ 2>/dev/null && echo "CI:github"
ls .gitlab-ci.yml .circleci/ bitrise.yml 2>/dev/null
```

If `.github/` exists (or no CI detected — default to GitHub Actions):
Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` with:
- `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
- Appropriate setup action for the runtime (setup-node, setup-ruby, setup-python, etc.)
- The same test command verified in B5
- Trigger: push + pull_request

If non-GitHub CI detected → skip CI generation with note: "Detected {provider} — CI pipeline generation supports GitHub Actions only. Add test step to your existing pipeline manually."

### B6. Create TESTING.md

First check: If TESTING.md already exists → read it and update/append rather than overwriting. Never destroy existing content.

Write TESTING.md with:
- Philosophy: "100% test coverage is the key to great vibe coding. Tests let you move fast, trust your instincts, and ship with confidence — without them, vibe coding is just yolo coding. With tests, it's a superpower."
- Framework name and version
- How to run tests (the verified command from B5)
- Test layers: Unit tests (what, where, when), Integration tests, Smoke tests, E2E tests
- Conventions: file naming, assertion style, setup/teardown patterns

### B7. Update CLAUDE.md

First check: If CLAUDE.md already has a `## Testing` section → skip. Don't duplicate.

Append a `## Testing` section:
- Run command and test directory
- Reference to TESTING.md
- Test expectations:
  - 100% test coverage is the goal — tests make vibe coding safe
  - When writing new functions, write a corresponding test
  - When fixing a bug, write a regression test
  - When adding error handling, write a test that triggers the error
  - When adding a conditional (if/else, switch), write tests for BOTH paths
  - Never commit code that makes existing tests fail

### B8. Commit

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

Only commit if there are changes. Stage all bootstrap files (config, test directory, TESTING.md, CLAUDE.md, .github/workflows/test.yml if created):
`git commit -m "chore: bootstrap test framework ({framework name})"`

---

**Create output directories:**

```bash
REPORT_DIR=".rasen/design-reports"
mkdir -p "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots"
```

## Phases 1-6: Design Audit Baseline

## Modes

### Full (default)
Systematic review of all pages reachable from homepage. Visit 5-8 pages. Full checklist evaluation, responsive screenshots, interaction flow testing. Produces complete design audit report with letter grades.

### Quick (`--quick`)
Homepage + 2 key pages only. First Impression + Design System Extraction + abbreviated checklist. Fastest path to a design score.

### Deep (`--deep`)
Comprehensive review: 10-15 pages, every interaction flow, exhaustive checklist. For pre-launch audits or major redesigns.

### Diff-aware (automatic when on a feature branch with no URL)
When on a feature branch, scope to pages affected by the branch changes:
1. Analyze the branch diff: `git diff main...HEAD --name-only`
2. Map changed files to affected pages/routes
3. Detect running app on common local ports (3000, 4000, 8080)
4. Audit only affected pages, compare design quality before/after

### Regression (`--regression` or previous `design-baseline.json` found)
Run full audit, then load previous `design-baseline.json`. Compare: per-category grade deltas, new findings, resolved findings. Output regression table in report.

---

## Phase 1: First Impression

The most uniquely designer-like output. Form a gut reaction before analyzing anything.

1. Navigate to the target URL
2. Take a full-page desktop screenshot: `curl --noproxy '*' "localhost:3456/screenshot?target=$TAB&file=$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/first-impression.png&full=true"`
3. Write the **First Impression** using this structured critique format:
   - "The site communicates **[what]**." (what it says at a glance — competence? playfulness? confusion?)
   - "I notice **[observation]**." (what stands out, positive or negative — be specific)
   - "The first 3 things my eye goes to are: **[1]**, **[2]**, **[3]**." (hierarchy check — are these intentional?)
   - "If I had to describe this in one word: **[word]**." (gut verdict)

This is the section users read first. Be opinionated. A designer doesn't hedge — they react.

---

## Phase 2: Design System Extraction

Extract the actual design system the site uses (not what a DESIGN.md says, but what's rendered):

```bash
# Fonts in use (capped at 500 elements to avoid timeout)
curl --noproxy '*' -sX POST "localhost:3456/eval?target=$TAB" -d "JSON.stringify([...new Set([...document.querySelectorAll('*')].slice(0,500).map(e => getComputedStyle(e).fontFamily))])"

# Color palette in use
curl --noproxy '*' -sX POST "localhost:3456/eval?target=$TAB" -d "JSON.stringify([...new Set([...document.querySelectorAll('*')].slice(0,500).flatMap(e => [getComputedStyle(e).color, getComputedStyle(e).backgroundColor]).filter(c => c !== 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)'))])"

# Heading hierarchy
curl --noproxy '*' -sX POST "localhost:3456/eval?target=$TAB" -d "JSON.stringify([...document.querySelectorAll('h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6')].map(h => ({tag:h.tagName, text:h.textContent.trim().slice(0,50), size:getComputedStyle(h).fontSize, weight:getComputedStyle(h).fontWeight})))"

# Touch target audit (find undersized interactive elements)
curl --noproxy '*' -sX POST "localhost:3456/eval?target=$TAB" -d "JSON.stringify([...document.querySelectorAll('a,button,input,[role=button]')].filter(e => {const r=e.getBoundingClientRect(); return r.width>0 && (r.width<44||r.height<44)}).map(e => ({tag:e.tagName, text:(e.textContent||'').trim().slice(0,30), w:Math.round(e.getBoundingClientRect().width), h:Math.round(e.getBoundingClientRect().height)})).slice(0,20))"

# Performance baseline — LCP/FCP/CLS + resource timing.
# The audit tab opens in the background and never renders, so paint/LCP come back
# null; pass &activate=true to briefly foreground it and sample real paint metrics
# (this steals focus for ~1.5s). Without it, treat null paint as "not rendered",
# not a page problem — check the returned "visibility"/"note" fields.
curl --noproxy '*' "localhost:3456/perf?target=$TAB&activate=true"
```

Structure findings as an **Inferred Design System**:
- **Fonts:** list with usage counts. Flag if >3 distinct font families.
- **Colors:** palette extracted. Flag if >12 unique non-gray colors. Note warm/cool/mixed.
- **Heading Scale:** h1-h6 sizes. Flag skipped levels, non-systematic size jumps.
- **Spacing Patterns:** sample padding/margin values. Flag non-scale values.

After extraction, offer: *"Want me to save this as your DESIGN.md? I can lock in these observations as your project's design system baseline."*

---

## Phase 3: Page-by-Page Visual Audit

For each page in scope:

```bash
curl --noproxy '*' "localhost:3456/navigate?target=$TAB&url=<url>"
curl --noproxy '*' "localhost:3456/snapshot?target=$TAB&mode=i"
curl --noproxy '*' "localhost:3456/screenshot?target=$TAB&file=$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/{page}-annotated.png&full=true"
curl --noproxy '*' "localhost:3456/responsive?target=$TAB&screenshot=true&dir=$REPORT_DIR/screenshots"
curl --noproxy '*' "localhost:3456/console/enable?target=$TAB"; curl --noproxy '*' "localhost:3456/console?target=$TAB&level=error"
curl --noproxy '*' "localhost:3456/perf?target=$TAB&activate=true"   # &activate=true: background audit tab won't render paint/LCP otherwise (steals focus ~1.5s)
```

### Auth Detection

After the first navigation, check if the URL changed to a login-like path:
```bash
curl --noproxy '*' "localhost:3456/info?target=$TAB"
```
If URL contains `/login`, `/signin`, `/auth`, or `/sso`: the site requires authentication. AskUserQuestion: "This site requires authentication. Provide a logged-in browser session (or import cookies for the domain) before continuing the audit."

### Design Audit Checklist (10 categories, ~80 items)

Apply these at each page. Each finding gets an impact rating (high/medium/polish) and category.

**1. Visual Hierarchy & Composition** (8 items)
- Clear focal point? One primary CTA per view?
- Eye flows naturally top-left to bottom-right?
- Visual noise — competing elements fighting for attention?
- Information density appropriate for content type?
- Z-index clarity — nothing unexpectedly overlapping?
- Above-the-fold content communicates purpose in 3 seconds?
- Squint test: hierarchy still visible when blurred?
- White space is intentional, not leftover?

**2. Typography** (15 items)
- Font count <=3 (flag if more)
- Scale follows ratio (1.25 major third or 1.333 perfect fourth)
- Line-height: 1.5x body, 1.15-1.25x headings
- Measure: 45-75 chars per line (66 ideal)
- Heading hierarchy: no skipped levels (h1→h3 without h2)
- Weight contrast: >=2 weights used for hierarchy
- No blacklisted fonts (Papyrus, Comic Sans, Lobster, Impact, Jokerman)
- If primary font is Inter/Roboto/Open Sans/Poppins → flag as potentially generic
- `text-wrap: balance` or `text-pretty` on headings (check via `curl --noproxy '*' -sX POST "localhost:3456/eval?target=$TAB" -d 'getComputedStyle(document.querySelector("<heading>")).textWrap'`)
- Curly quotes used, not straight quotes
- Ellipsis character (`…`) not three dots (`...`)
- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on number columns
- Body text >= 16px
- Caption/label >= 12px
- No letterspacing on lowercase text

**3. Color & Contrast** (10 items)
- Palette coherent (<=12 unique non-gray colors)
- WCAG AA: body text 4.5:1, large text (18px+) 3:1, UI components 3:1
- Semantic colors consistent (success=green, error=red, warning=yellow/amber)
- No color-only encoding (always add labels, icons, or patterns)
- Dark mode: surfaces use elevation, not just lightness inversion
- Dark mode: text off-white (~#E0E0E0), not pure white
- Primary accent desaturated 10-20% in dark mode
- `color-scheme: dark` on html element (if dark mode present)
- No red/green only combinations (8% of men have red-green deficiency)
- Neutral palette is warm or cool consistently — not mixed

**4. Spacing & Layout** (12 items)
- Grid consistent at all breakpoints
- Spacing uses a scale (4px or 8px base), not arbitrary values
- Alignment is consistent — nothing floats outside the grid
- Rhythm: related items closer together, distinct sections further apart
- Border-radius hierarchy (not uniform bubbly radius on everything)
- Inner radius = outer radius - gap (nested elements)
- No horizontal scroll on mobile
- Max content width set (no full-bleed body text)
- `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for notch devices
- URL reflects state (filters, tabs, pagination in query params)
- Flex/grid used for layout (not JS measurement)
- Breakpoints: mobile (375), tablet (768), desktop (1024), wide (1440)

**5. Interaction States** (10 items)
- Hover state on all interactive elements
- `focus-visible` ring present (never `outline: none` without replacement)
- Active/pressed state with depth effect or color shift
- Disabled state: reduced opacity + `cursor: not-allowed`
- Loading: skeleton shapes match real content layout
- Empty states: warm message + primary action + visual (not just "No items.")
- Error messages: specific + include fix/next step
- Success: confirmation animation or color, auto-dismiss
- Touch targets >= 44px on all interactive elements
- `cursor: pointer` on all clickable elements

**6. Responsive Design** (8 items)
- Mobile layout makes *design* sense (not just stacked desktop columns)
- Touch targets sufficient on mobile (>= 44px)
- No horizontal scroll on any viewport
- Images handle responsive (srcset, sizes, or CSS containment)
- Text readable without zooming on mobile (>= 16px body)
- Navigation collapses appropriately (hamburger, bottom nav, etc.)
- Forms usable on mobile (correct input types, no autoFocus on mobile)
- No `user-scalable=no` or `maximum-scale=1` in viewport meta

**7. Motion & Animation** (6 items)
- Easing: ease-out for entering, ease-in for exiting, ease-in-out for moving
- Duration: 50-700ms range (nothing slower unless page transition)
- Purpose: every animation communicates something (state change, attention, spatial relationship)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected (check: `curl --noproxy '*' -sX POST "localhost:3456/eval?target=$TAB" -d "matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches"`)
- No `transition: all` — properties listed explicitly
- Only `transform` and `opacity` animated (not layout properties like width, height, top, left)

**8. Content & Microcopy** (8 items)
- Empty states designed with warmth (message + action + illustration/icon)
- Error messages specific: what happened + why + what to do next
- Button labels specific ("Save API Key" not "Continue" or "Submit")
- No placeholder/lorem ipsum text visible in production
- Truncation handled (`text-overflow: ellipsis`, `line-clamp`, or `break-words`)
- Active voice ("Install the CLI" not "The CLI will be installed")
- Loading states end with `…` ("Saving…" not "Saving...")
- Destructive actions have confirmation modal or undo window

**9. AI Slop Detection** (10 anti-patterns — the blacklist)

The test: would a human designer at a respected studio ever ship this?

- Purple/violet/indigo gradient backgrounds or blue-to-purple color schemes
- **The 3-column feature grid:** icon-in-colored-circle + bold title + 2-line description, repeated 3x symmetrically. THE most recognizable AI layout.
- Icons in colored circles as section decoration (SaaS starter template look)
- Centered everything (`text-align: center` on all headings, descriptions, cards)
- Uniform bubbly border-radius on every element (same large radius on everything)
- Decorative blobs, floating circles, wavy SVG dividers (if a section feels empty, it needs better content, not decoration)
- Emoji as design elements (rockets in headings, emoji as bullet points)
- Colored left-border on cards (`border-left: 3px solid <accent>`)
- Generic hero copy ("Welcome to [X]", "Unlock the power of...", "Your all-in-one solution for...")
- Cookie-cutter section rhythm (hero → 3 features → testimonials → pricing → CTA, every section same height)

**10. Performance as Design** (6 items)
- LCP < 2.0s (web apps), < 1.5s (informational sites)
- CLS < 0.1 (no visible layout shifts during load)
- Skeleton quality: shapes match real content, shimmer animation
- Images: `loading="lazy"`, width/height dimensions set, WebP/AVIF format
- Fonts: `font-display: swap`, preconnect to CDN origins
- No visible font swap flash (FOUT) — critical fonts preloaded

## Phase 4: Interaction Flow Review

Walk 2-3 key user flows and evaluate the *feel*, not just the function:

```bash
curl --noproxy '*' "localhost:3456/snapshot?target=$TAB&mode=i"
curl --noproxy '*' -sX POST "localhost:3456/click?target=$TAB" -d '<selector>'   # perform action
curl --noproxy '*' "localhost:3456/snapshot?target=$TAB&mode=D"                  # diff to see what changed
```

Evaluate:
- **Response feel:** Does clicking feel responsive? Any delays or missing loading states?
- **Transition quality:** Are transitions intentional or generic/absent?
- **Feedback clarity:** Did the action clearly succeed or fail? Is the feedback immediate?
- **Form polish:** Focus states visible? Validation timing correct? Errors near the source?

---

## Phase 5: Cross-Page Consistency

Compare screenshots and observations across pages for:
- Navigation bar consistent across all pages?
- Footer consistent?
- Component reuse vs one-off designs (same button styled differently on different pages?)
- Tone consistency (one page playful while another is corporate?)
- Spacing rhythm carries across pages?

---

## Phase 6: Compile Report

### Output Locations

**Local:** `.rasen/design-reports/design-audit-{domain}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

**Project-scoped:**
```bash
SLUG=$(basename "$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null)" .git 2>/dev/null || basename "$(pwd)") && mkdir -p ~/.rasen/projects/$SLUG
```
Write to: `~/.rasen/projects/{slug}/{user}-{branch}-design-audit-{datetime}.md`

**Baseline:** Write `design-baseline.json` for regression mode:
```json
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "url": "<target>",
  "designScore": "B",
  "aiSlopScore": "C",
  "categoryGrades": { "hierarchy": "A", "typography": "B", ... },
  "findings": [{ "id": "FINDING-001", "title": "...", "impact": "high", "category": "typography" }]
}
```

### Scoring System

**Dual headline scores:**
- **Design Score: {A-F}** — weighted average of all 10 categories
- **AI Slop Score: {A-F}** — standalone grade with pithy verdict

**Per-category grades:**
- **A:** Intentional, polished, delightful. Shows design thinking.
- **B:** Solid fundamentals, minor inconsistencies. Looks professional.
- **C:** Functional but generic. No major problems, no design point of view.
- **D:** Noticeable problems. Feels unfinished or careless.
- **F:** Actively hurting user experience. Needs significant rework.

**Grade computation:** Each category starts at A. Each High-impact finding drops one letter grade. Each Medium-impact finding drops half a letter grade. Polish findings are noted but do not affect grade. Minimum is F.

**Category weights for Design Score:**
| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Visual Hierarchy | 15% |
| Typography | 15% |
| Spacing & Layout | 15% |
| Color & Contrast | 10% |
| Interaction States | 10% |
| Responsive | 10% |
| Content Quality | 10% |
| AI Slop | 5% |
| Motion | 5% |
| Performance Feel | 5% |

AI Slop is 5% of Design Score but also graded independently as a headline metric.

### Regression Output

When previous `design-baseline.json` exists or `--regression` flag is used:
- Load baseline grades
- Compare: per-category deltas, new findings, resolved findings
- Append regression table to report

---

## Design Critique Format

Use structured feedback, not opinions:
- "I notice..." — observation (e.g., "I notice the primary CTA competes with the secondary action")
- "I wonder..." — question (e.g., "I wonder if users will understand what 'Process' means here")
- "What if..." — suggestion (e.g., "What if we moved search to a more prominent position?")
- "I think... because..." — reasoned opinion (e.g., "I think the spacing between sections is too uniform because it doesn't create hierarchy")

Tie everything to user goals and product objectives. Always suggest specific improvements alongside problems.

---

## Important Rules

1. **Think like a designer, not a QA engineer.** You care whether things feel right, look intentional, and respect the user. You do NOT just care whether things "work."
2. **Screenshots are evidence.** Every finding needs at least one screenshot. Use `/screenshot` (add `&full=true` for the whole page) and pair it with a `/snapshot` to identify the elements involved.
3. **Be specific and actionable.** "Change X to Y because Z" — not "the spacing feels off."
4. **Never read source code to FORM findings — audit phase only.** Evaluate the rendered site, not the implementation: do not form design findings by reading code instead of looking at the rendered page. Exceptions where reading source IS allowed: (a) offer to write DESIGN.md from extracted observations; (b) reading changed files to map them to affected pages in **diff-aware mode**; and (c) the **standalone fix loop** (design-review Phase 8, when a human runs /design-review directly), which reads source to make the minimal fix. Carve-out (c) names the STANDALONE fix loop only — it does NOT reopen the dispatched-mode report-only contract.
5. **AI Slop detection is your superpower.** Most developers can't evaluate whether their site looks AI-generated. You can. Be direct about it.
6. **Quick wins matter.** Always include a "Quick Wins" section — the 3-5 highest-impact fixes that take <30 minutes each.
7. **Use `/snapshot?mode=C` for tricky UIs.** Finds clickable divs (@c refs) that the accessibility tree misses.
8. **Responsive is design, not just "not broken."** A stacked desktop layout on mobile is not responsive design — it's lazy. Evaluate whether the mobile layout makes *design* sense.
9. **Document incrementally.** Write each finding to the report as you find it. Don't batch.
10. **Depth over breadth.** 5-10 well-documented findings with screenshots and specific suggestions > 20 vague observations.
11. **Show screenshots to the user.** After every `/screenshot` or `/responsive` call that writes a file, use the Read tool on the output file(s) so the user can see them inline. For `/responsive` (up to 3 files), Read all of them. This is critical — without it, screenshots are invisible to the user.

Record baseline design score and AI slop score at end of Phase 6.

## Phase 7: Triage

Sort all discovered findings by impact, then decide which to fix:

- **High Impact:** Fix first. These affect the first impression and hurt user trust.
- **Medium Impact:** Fix next. These reduce polish and are felt subconsciously.
- **Polish:** Fix if time allows. These separate good from great.

Mark findings that cannot be fixed from source code (e.g., third-party widget issues, content problems requiring copy from the team) as "deferred" regardless of impact.

---

## Phase 8: Fix Loop

**Dispatched mode:** do NOT run the fix loop and do NOT commit. Report every finding tagged with a canonical severity (impact `high`→Major — or Blocker if the UI is broken/unusable, `medium`→Minor, `polish`→Trivial; finding content overrides the label) for the LEAD to route to a non-author fixer. Phases 8 and 9 (fix loop, per-fix commit, regression tests, final re-audit) are standalone only.

**Standalone mode.** For each fixable finding, in impact order:

### 8a. Locate source

```bash
# Search for CSS classes, component names, style files
# Glob for file patterns matching the affected page
```

- Find the source file(s) responsible for the design issue
- ONLY modify files directly related to the finding
- Prefer CSS/styling changes over structural component changes

### 8b. Fix

- Read the source code, understand the context
- Make the **minimal fix** — smallest change that resolves the design issue
- CSS-only changes are preferred (safer, more reversible)
- Do NOT refactor surrounding code, add features, or "improve" unrelated things

### 8c. Commit

```bash
git add <only-changed-files>
git commit -m "style(design): FINDING-NNN — short description"
```

- One commit per fix. Never bundle multiple fixes.
- Message format: `style(design): FINDING-NNN — short description`

### 8d. Re-test

Navigate back to the affected page and verify the fix:

```bash
curl "localhost:3456/navigate?target=$TAB&url=<affected-url>"
curl "localhost:3456/screenshot?target=$TAB&file=$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/finding-NNN-after.png"
curl "localhost:3456/console?target=$TAB&level=error"
curl "localhost:3456/snapshot?target=$TAB&mode=D"
```

Take **before/after screenshot pair** for every fix.

### 8e. Classify

- **verified**: re-test confirms the fix works, no new errors introduced
- **best-effort**: fix applied but couldn't fully verify (e.g., needs specific browser state)
- **reverted**: regression detected → `git revert HEAD` → mark finding as "deferred"

### 8e.5. Regression Test (design-review variant)

Design fixes are typically CSS-only. Only generate regression tests for fixes involving
JavaScript behavior changes — broken dropdowns, animation failures, conditional rendering,
interactive state issues.

For CSS-only fixes: skip entirely. CSS regressions are caught by re-running /design-review.

If the fix involved JS behavior: follow the same procedure as /qa Phase 8e.5 (study existing
test patterns, write a regression test encoding the exact bug condition, run it, commit if
passes or defer if fails). Commit format: `test(design): regression test for FINDING-NNN`.

### 8f. Self-Regulation (STOP AND EVALUATE)

Every 5 fixes (or after any revert), compute the design-fix risk level:

```
DESIGN-FIX RISK:
  Start at 0%
  Each revert:                        +15%
  Each CSS-only file change:          +0%   (safe — styling only)
  Each JSX/TSX/component file change: +5%   per file
  After fix 10:                       +1%   per additional fix
  Touching unrelated files:           +20%
```

**If risk > 20%:** STOP immediately. Show the user what you've done so far. Ask whether to continue.

**Hard cap: 30 fixes.** After 30 fixes, stop regardless of remaining findings.

---

## Phase 9: Final Design Audit

After all fixes are applied:

1. Re-run the design audit on all affected pages
2. Compute final design score and AI slop score
3. **If final scores are WORSE than baseline:** WARN prominently — something regressed

---

## Phase 10: Report

**Dispatched mode:** write ONLY `design-review-report.md` in the change's work directory (per the PREAMBLE's dispatched-mode rule; fall back to the change directory), each finding tagged with a canonical severity (impact `high`→Major — Blocker if broken/unusable, `medium`→Minor, `polish`→Trivial); skip the `.rasen/design-reports/` and `~/.rasen/projects/` writes. Then return.

**Standalone mode.** Write the report to both local and project-scoped locations:

**Local:** `.rasen/design-reports/design-audit-{domain}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

**Project-scoped:**
```bash
SLUG=$(basename "$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null)" .git 2>/dev/null || basename "$(pwd)") && mkdir -p ~/.rasen/projects/$SLUG
```
Write to `~/.rasen/projects/{slug}/{user}-{branch}-design-audit-{datetime}.md`

**Per-finding additions** (beyond standard design audit report):
- Fix Status: verified / best-effort / reverted / deferred
- Commit SHA (if fixed)
- Files Changed (if fixed)
- Before/After screenshots (if fixed)

**Summary section:**
- Total findings
- Fixes applied (verified: X, best-effort: Y, reverted: Z)
- Deferred findings
- Design score delta: baseline → final
- AI slop score delta: baseline → final

**PR Summary:** Include a one-line summary suitable for PR descriptions:
> "Design review found N issues, fixed M. Design score X → Y, AI slop score X → Y."

---

## Phase 11: TODOS.md Update

If the repo has a `TODOS.md`:

1. **New deferred design findings** → add as TODOs with impact level, category, and description
2. **Fixed findings that were in TODOS.md** → annotate with "Fixed by /design-review on {branch}, {date}"

---

## Additional Rules (design-review specific)

11. **Clean working tree required.** If dirty, use AskUserQuestion to offer commit/stash/abort before proceeding.
12. **One commit per fix.** Never bundle multiple design fixes into one commit.
13. **Only modify tests when generating regression tests in Phase 8e.5.** Never modify CI configuration. Never modify existing tests — only create new test files.
14. **Revert on regression.** If a fix makes things worse, `git revert HEAD` immediately.
15. **Self-regulate.** Follow the design-fix risk heuristic. When in doubt, stop and ask.
16. **CSS-first.** Prefer CSS/styling changes over structural component changes. CSS-only changes are safer and more reversible.
17. **DESIGN.md export.** You MAY write a DESIGN.md file if the user accepts the offer from Phase 2.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone Rasen repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `rasen store list --json` to discover registered store ids and project ids (the `type` field on each entry), then pass `--store <id>` (or `--project <id>` for a project registered via `store add-project`) on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, and the top-level `context`). The `rasen pipeline` inspection group (`pipeline list`, `pipeline show`, `pipeline agents`, `pipeline classify`, `pipeline resume`) also accepts `--store <id>`/`--project <id>` and resolves its root exactly like `validate` — in a store- or project-scoped run you MUST thread the SAME flag onto `pipeline resume <change>` so it reads the change's run-state from that root's change directory, not the cwd. `--store` and `--project` are mutually exclusive on one invocation — pass only one. A store and a project may share the same id (they are separate namespaces); a bare id with neither flag always means the store namespace. Commands outside those two groups do not take either flag — in particular `rasen agent context` (the agent-runtime probe) is NOT the same command as the top-level `rasen context` and does NOT accept `--store`/`--project`; do not paste either flag onto it. Hints printed by commands already carry the right flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store or project flag, commands act on the nearest local `rasen/` root.
