Archive multiple completed changes in a single operation.

This skill allows you to batch-archive changes, handling spec conflicts intelligently by checking the codebase to determine what's actually implemented.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone Rasen repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `rasen store list --json` to discover registered store ids and project ids (the `type` field on each entry), then pass `--store <id>` (or `--project <id>` for a project registered via `store add-project`) on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, and the top-level `context`). The `rasen pipeline` inspection group (`pipeline list`, `pipeline show`, `pipeline agents`, `pipeline classify`, `pipeline resume`) also accepts `--store <id>`/`--project <id>` and resolves its root exactly like `validate` — in a store- or project-scoped run you MUST thread the SAME flag onto `pipeline resume <change>` so it reads the change's run-state from that root's change directory, not the cwd. `--store` and `--project` are mutually exclusive on one invocation — pass only one. A store and a project may share the same id (they are separate namespaces); a bare id with neither flag always means the store namespace. Commands outside those two groups do not take either flag — in particular `rasen agent context` (the agent-runtime probe) is NOT the same command as the top-level `rasen context` and does NOT accept `--store`/`--project`; do not paste either flag onto it. Hints printed by commands already carry the right flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store or project flag, commands act on the nearest local `rasen/` root.

**Input**: None required (prompts for selection)

**Steps**

1. **Get active changes**

   Run `rasen list --json` to get all active changes.

   If no active changes exist, inform user and stop.

2. **Prompt for change selection**

   Use **AskUserQuestion tool** with multi-select to let user choose changes:
   - Show each change with its schema
   - Include an option for "All changes"
   - Allow any number of selections (1+ works, 2+ is the typical use case)

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT auto-select. Always let the user choose.

3. **Batch validation - gather status for all selected changes**

   For each selected change, collect:

   a. **Artifact status** - Run `rasen status --change "<name>" --json`
      - Parse `schemaName`, `artifacts`, `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, `artifactPaths`, and `actionContext`
      - Note which artifacts are `done` vs other states
      - Also record `archive.destination` (`in-repo` | `external` | `prune`) and `archive.archiveDir` (absent for `prune` or an unresolvable `external`) — one status call per change already happens, so no extra call is needed for this

   b. **Task completion** - Read `artifactPaths.tasks.existingOutputPaths` from status JSON
      - Count `- [ ]` (incomplete) vs `- [x]` (complete)
      - If no tasks file exists, note as "No tasks"

   c. **Delta specs** - Check `artifactPaths.specs.existingOutputPaths` from status JSON
      - List which capability specs exist
      - For each, extract requirement names (lines matching `### Requirement: <name>`)

4. **Detect spec conflicts**

   Build a map of `capability -> [changes that touch it]`:

   ```
   auth -> [change-a, change-b]  <- CONFLICT (2+ changes)
   api  -> [change-c]            <- OK (only 1 change)
   ```

   A conflict exists when 2+ selected changes have delta specs for the same capability.

5. **Resolve conflicts agentically**

   **For each conflict**, investigate the codebase:

   a. **Read the delta specs** from each conflicting change to understand what each claims to add/modify

   b. **Search the codebase** for implementation evidence:
      - Look for code implementing requirements from each delta spec
      - Check for related files, functions, or tests

   c. **Determine resolution**:
      - If only one change is actually implemented -> sync that one's specs
      - If both implemented -> apply in chronological order (older first, newer overwrites)
      - If neither implemented -> skip spec sync, warn user

   d. **Record resolution** for each conflict:
      - Which change's specs to apply
      - In what order (if both)
      - Rationale (what was found in codebase)

6. **Show consolidated status table**

   Display a table summarizing all changes:

   ```
   | Change              | Artifacts | Tasks | Specs   | Conflicts | Status |
   |---------------------|-----------|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
   | schema-management   | Done      | 5/5   | 2 delta | None      | Ready  |
   | project-config      | Done      | 3/3   | 1 delta | None      | Ready  |
   | add-oauth           | Done      | 4/4   | 1 delta | auth (!)  | Ready* |
   | add-verify-skill    | 1 left    | 2/5   | None    | None      | Warn   |
   ```

   For conflicts, show the resolution:
   ```
   * Conflict resolution:
     - auth spec: Will apply add-oauth then add-jwt (both implemented, chronological order)
   ```

   For incomplete changes, show warnings:
   ```
   Warnings:
   - add-verify-skill: 1 incomplete artifact, 3 incomplete tasks
   ```

7. **Confirm batch operation**

   Use **AskUserQuestion tool** with a single confirmation:

   - "Archive N changes?" with options based on status
   - Options might include:
     - "Archive all N changes"
     - "Archive only N ready changes (skip incomplete)"
     - "Cancel"

   If there are incomplete changes, make clear they'll be archived with warnings.

8. **Execute archive for each confirmed change**

   Process changes in the determined order (respecting conflict resolution):

   a. **Sync specs** if delta specs exist:
      - Use the rasen-sync-specs approach (agent-driven intelligent merge)
      - For conflicts, apply in resolved order
      - Track if sync was done

   b. **Perform the archive (destination-aware, same branch and preconditions as `rasen-archive-change`)**:

      For `external` and `prune`, both of which remove the repository's only copy of this change's review material, verify BEFORE bookkeeping, per change: the change directory must be BOTH clean AND tracked — `git status --porcelain --ignored -- <changeRoot>` empty (plain `--porcelain` without `--ignored` is NOT enough; gitignored content is invisible to it and would otherwise read as "clean" while never having been committed) AND `git ls-files -- <changeRoot>` non-empty (the directory must actually have committed content) — else fail that change with "commit the change directory first" (or "no content in git history — commit it first" when nothing is tracked) and continue with others. `prune` additionally needs a confirmation naming the deletion, SEPARATE from step 7's routine batch confirmation (call it out per-change explicitly — one consent must never silently authorize the other) — REFUSE that change outright in a non-interactive / dispatched context without a prior explicit override naming the deletion.

      `in-repo` (default, and the fallback for `external` when `archiveDir` is absent — state the fallback explicitly, never escalate it to deletion):
      ```bash
      mkdir -p "<planningHome.changesDir>/archive"
      mv "<changeRoot>" "<planningHome.changesDir>/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>"
      ```

      `external` (same date-prefix/collision rule, targeting the resolved `archiveDir` instead):
      ```bash
      mkdir -p "<archiveDir>"
      mv "<changeRoot>" "<archiveDir>/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>"
      ```

      `prune` (after the preconditions above pass, per change):
      1. Write the prune tombstone FIRST (same mechanism and literal `Pruned:` token as `rasen-archive-change` — resolve `workDir` from status, append `**Pruned:** true` / `**Pruned at:** <timestamp>` to its `ship-log.md`; proceed without one if it cannot be resolved, noting the gap in this change's outcome).
      2. Delete:
         ```bash
         rm -rf "<changeRoot>"
         ```
      No archive directory is created for a pruned change — git history is the archive.

      **Post-bookkeeping commit guidance** (per change, same as `rasen-archive-change`, including its CONDITIONAL ship-referencing commit-message form — the "specs synced" clause included only when that change actually had delta specs synced this run, dropped entirely when it had none or sync was skipped; the ship suffix omitted, never invented, when that change's own ship log records no `Commit:`; four resulting forms, same as `rasen-archive-change` step 5): for `external`/`prune`, `git add -- <changeRoot> <specsDir>` then `git commit -m "chore(rasen): archive <name> (specs synced; ship <short-sha>)" -- <changeRoot> <specsDir>` (substituting the form that matches this change's actual sync/ship state) — the `add` step matters because a spec sync that created a new (untracked) capability directory would otherwise be silently left out of a bare `git commit --`. For `in-repo`, the archive-dir addition rides the commit as usual, same conditional message form.

   b.5. **Close the delivery chain per change (`sha-cross-stamping`, same mechanism as `rasen-archive-change` step 5.5, INCLUDING its mint-on-demand `workDir` resolution and sticky-legacy caveat — never a silent fallback to `changeRoot`, which `external`/`prune` are about to move or delete)**: for each successfully bookkept change, before its post-bookkeeping commit, append an `## Archive` section (`Date`, `Ship commit` copied from that change's own ship-log `Commit:` line — omitted when absent, `Outcome`) to its work-directory `ship-log.md` (create a minimal `# Ship Log: <name>` header first if none exists); after the commit, append `Archive commit: <sha>` (`git rev-parse HEAD`). Same append-only rule as `rasen-archive-change` — never rewrite the ship-side section.

   c. **Track outcome** for each change:
      - Success: archived successfully (record the destination and, unless pruned, the location)
      - Failed: error during archive (record error) — includes a destructive-destination precondition failure
      - Skipped: user chose not to archive (if applicable)

9. **Display summary**

   Show final results:

   ```
   ## Bulk Archive Complete

   Archived 3 changes:
   - schema-management-cli -> archive/2026-01-19-schema-management-cli/
   - project-config -> archive/2026-01-19-project-config/
   - add-oauth -> archive/2026-01-19-add-oauth/

   Skipped 1 change:
   - add-verify-skill (user chose not to archive incomplete)

   Spec sync summary:
   - 4 delta specs synced to main specs
   - 1 conflict resolved (auth: applied both in chronological order)
   ```

   If any failures:
   ```
   Failed 1 change:
   - some-change: Archive directory already exists
   ```

**Conflict Resolution Examples**

Example 1: Only one implemented
```
Conflict: specs/auth/spec.md touched by [add-oauth, add-jwt]

Checking add-oauth:
- Delta adds "OAuth Provider Integration" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/auth/oauth.ts implementing OAuth flow

Checking add-jwt:
- Delta adds "JWT Token Handling" requirement
- Searching codebase... no JWT implementation found

Resolution: Only add-oauth is implemented. Will sync add-oauth specs only.
```

Example 2: Both implemented
```
Conflict: specs/api/spec.md touched by [add-rest-api, add-graphql]

Checking add-rest-api (created 2026-01-10):
- Delta adds "REST Endpoints" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/api/rest.ts

Checking add-graphql (created 2026-01-15):
- Delta adds "GraphQL Schema" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/api/graphql.ts

Resolution: Both implemented. Will apply add-rest-api specs first,
then add-graphql specs (chronological order, newer takes precedence).
```

**Output On Success**

```
## Bulk Archive Complete

Archived N changes:
- <change-1> [in-repo] -> archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<change-1>/
- <change-2> [external] -> <machine-home>/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<change-2>/
- <change-3> [prune] -> pruned (no archive copy; git history is the archive)

Spec sync summary:
- N delta specs synced to main specs
- No conflicts (or: M conflicts resolved)
```

Each archived change's ship-log gained a chain record (`## Archive` section: ship commit, archive commit, outcome) and its archive commit message carries `ship <short-sha>` when that change was shipped — not shown in the compact summary above; inspect the individual change's `ship-log.md` for the full record.

**Output On Partial Success**

```
## Bulk Archive Complete (partial)

Archived N changes:
- <change-1> [in-repo] -> archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<change-1>/

Skipped M changes:
- <change-2> (user chose not to archive incomplete)

Failed K changes:
- <change-3>: Archive directory already exists
- <change-4>: destination external/prune blocked — uncommitted content in the change directory
```

**Output When No Changes**

```
## No Changes to Archive

No active changes found. Create a new change to get started.
```

**Guardrails**
- Allow any number of changes (1+ is fine, 2+ is the typical use case)
- Always prompt for selection, never auto-select
- Detect spec conflicts early and resolve by checking codebase
- When both changes are implemented, apply specs in chronological order
- Skip spec sync only when implementation is missing (warn user)
- Show clear per-change status before confirming
- Use single confirmation for entire batch
- Track and report all outcomes (success/skip/fail)
- Preserve .openspec.yaml when moving to archive (in-repo and external only — a pruned change has no archived directory)
- Archive directory target uses current date: YYYY-MM-DD-<name>
- If archive target exists, fail that change but continue with others
- **Destructive-destination preconditions, per change.** `external` and `prune` REFUSE that individual change unless it is BOTH clean (`git status --porcelain --ignored -- <changeRoot>` empty — `--ignored` matters, a gitignored change directory reads clean without it) AND tracked (`git ls-files -- <changeRoot>` non-empty), or (for `prune`) without its own confirmation naming the deletion — a SEPARATE consent from the batch confirmation in step 7 — fail that change and continue with the rest of the batch, exactly like an existing-target failure. A destination fallback (`external` → `in-repo`) MAY relocate a change; it must NEVER escalate to deletion.
- **Chain-record append (Step 8b.5), per change, is append-only.** Same rule as `rasen-archive-change`: never rewrite a change's ship-side ship-log section; its ship commit SHA is a copied recorded fact, never re-derived or invented — omit the ship reference for a never-shipped change in the batch rather than fabricating one.
