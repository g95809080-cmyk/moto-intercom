Enhanced verification — combines Rasen completeness/correctness/consistency checks with expert reviews.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone Rasen repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `rasen store list --json` to discover registered store ids and project ids (the `type` field on each entry), then pass `--store <id>` (or `--project <id>` for a project registered via `store add-project`) on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, and the top-level `context`). The `rasen pipeline` inspection group (`pipeline list`, `pipeline show`, `pipeline agents`, `pipeline classify`, `pipeline resume`) also accepts `--store <id>`/`--project <id>` and resolves its root exactly like `validate` — in a store- or project-scoped run you MUST thread the SAME flag onto `pipeline resume <change>` so it reads the change's run-state from that root's change directory, not the cwd. `--store` and `--project` are mutually exclusive on one invocation — pass only one. A store and a project may share the same id (they are separate namespaces); a bare id with neither flag always means the store namespace. Commands outside those two groups do not take either flag — in particular `rasen agent context` (the agent-runtime probe) is NOT the same command as the top-level `rasen context` and does NOT accept `--store`/`--project`; do not paste either flag onto it. Hints printed by commands already carry the right flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store or project flag, commands act on the nearest local `rasen/` root.

Automatically adjusts review depth based on task size. Reports saved to the change's work directory (fallback: the change directory).

## When to Use

Use when: "verify", "review", "check my code", "run tests", "QA", "verify the change", "does it look right?".

## Steps

### 1. Select the Change

If a change name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
- Infer from conversation context
- Auto-select if only one active change exists
- If ambiguous, run `rasen list --json` and prompt for selection

### 2. Classify Change Scope

Determine verification depth by analyzing the change:

| Scope | Criteria | Pipeline |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Full** | Multi-file changes, UI components, significant scope | artifact checks + /review + /cso (if security) + /qa + /design-review (if UI) |
| **Standard** | Small single-purpose feature | artifact checks + /review + conditional /cso + /qa-only |
| **Light** | Bug fix, minimal scope | artifact checks + /review only |

**Inputs for classification:**
- Number of files changed (check with `git diff --stat`)
- Presence of UI components (check for .tsx/.jsx/.vue/.svelte files in diff)
- Proposal scope description (read proposal.md if exists)
- Task count from tasks.md

Display the classification and allow user override.

### 3. Run Rasen Artifact Consistency Checks

```bash
rasen status --change "<name>" --json
```

Verify:
- All required artifacts exist and are complete
- Tasks in tasks.md match the implementation scope
- Proposal, design, and specs are consistent with each other

Report any inconsistencies found.

### 4. Run Expert Reviews Based on Scope

**Full scope:**
1. Invoke `/review` — adversarial code review with auto-scaled depth + test coverage audit
2. If security-relevant (touches auth, input validation, crypto, data handling): invoke `/cso` — security audit
3. Invoke `/qa` — browser-based quality assurance testing
4. If UI change: invoke `/design-review` — visual audit + auto-fix suggestions

**Standard scope:**
1. Invoke `/review` — code review
2. If security-relevant: invoke `/cso` — security audit
3. Invoke `/qa-only` — abbreviated QA check (no browser)

**Light scope:**
1. Invoke `/review` — code review only

### 5. Save Reports

Write reports to the change's work directory (resolve `workDir` from `rasen status --change <name> --json`; fall back to the change directory when it is absent or a report already lives there):
- `review-report.md` — code review findings
- `cso-report.md` — security audit (if /cso ran)
- `qa-report.md` — QA findings (if /qa ran)
- `design-review-report.md` — design review (if /design-review ran)

**Canonical verdict + status line.** Map every finding across the stages onto the canonical Blocker/Major/Minor/Trivial scale defined by the `canonical-severity-vocabulary` in the expert PREAMBLE (reference it; do NOT re-define the scale): a Critical Issue / a stage FAIL on a blocking check → **Blocker**; a Warning → **Major**; a nice-to-fix → **Minor** or **Trivial**. Per-stage PASS/FAIL stays as a display aid in the summary below. Emit ONE machine-checkable status line into the reports you write and the conversation:

```
VERIFY VERDICT: <CLEAN|BLOCKED> — Blocker:<n> Major:<n> Minor:<n> Trivial:<n>
```

The verdict is **CLEAN if and only if no Blocker and no Major is open** (the review-cycle termination invariant); otherwise **BLOCKED**. This standardizes the vocabulary and the pass rule only; it does not by itself enforce an archive refusal.

**Test-evidence block (only when tests ran).** If verification executed the project's test or gate suite, record a fingerprinted test-evidence block into the report(s) so `/rasen:ship`'s evidence-based test-skip gate can honor it — the same schema `review-cycle-report.md` records:

```
TEST EVIDENCE
- command: <exact command(s) run>
- result: pass | fail
- tree: <git rev-parse HEAD^{tree}>
```

If no test/gate suite was run, write no test-evidence block — ship then correctly re-runs (it skips on proof, never on hope).

### 6. Consolidated Summary

Display a summary with pass/fail status for each stage:

```
## Verification Complete: <change-name>

**Scope:** Full | Standard | Light

| Stage | Status | Issues |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Artifact Consistency | PASS/FAIL | <count> |
| Code Review (/review) | PASS/FAIL | <count> |
| Security (/cso) | PASS/FAIL | <count> |
| QA (/qa) | PASS/FAIL | <count> |
| Design Review | PASS/FAIL | <count> |

### Critical Issues (must fix before shipping)
- <issue 1>
- <issue 2>

### Warnings (recommended to fix)
- <warning 1>

### Reports
- review-report.md
- cso-report.md (if applicable)
- qa-report.md (if applicable)
```

## Integration Notes

- This command coexists with the original `rasen-verify-change` skill (pure artifact consistency check)
- The enhanced version adds expert review layers on top of artifact checks
- Reports written to the work directory are consumed by `/rasen:retro` and `/rasen:archive`
- `/rasen:ship` checks for verification reports before proceeding
