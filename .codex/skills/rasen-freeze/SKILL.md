# /freeze — Restrict Edits to a Directory

Lock file edits to a specific directory. Any Edit or Write operation targeting
a file outside the allowed path will be **blocked** (not just warned).

## Setup

Ask the user which directory to restrict edits to. Use AskUserQuestion:

- Question: "Which directory should I restrict edits to? Files outside this path will be blocked from editing."
- Text input (not multiple choice) — the user types a path.

Once the user provides a directory path:

1. Resolve it to an absolute path:
```bash
FREEZE_DIR=$(cd "<user-provided-path>" 2>/dev/null && pwd)
echo "$FREEZE_DIR"
```

2. Ensure trailing slash and save to the freeze state file:
```bash
FREEZE_DIR="${FREEZE_DIR%/}/"
STATE_DIR="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA:-$HOME/.gstack}"
mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR"
echo "$FREEZE_DIR" > "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt"
echo "Freeze boundary set: $FREEZE_DIR"
```

Tell the user: "Edits are now restricted to `<path>/`. Any Edit or Write
outside this directory will be blocked. To change the boundary, run `/freeze`
again. To remove it, run `/unfreeze` or end the session."

## How it works

The hook reads `file_path` from the Edit/Write tool input JSON, then checks
whether the path starts with the freeze directory. If not, it returns
`permissionDecision: "deny"` to block the operation.

The freeze boundary persists for the session via the state file. The hook
script reads it on every Edit/Write invocation.

## Notes

- The trailing `/` on the freeze directory prevents `/src` from matching `/src-old`
- Freeze applies to Edit and Write tools only — Read, Bash, Glob, Grep are unaffected
- This prevents accidental edits, not a security boundary — Bash commands like `sed` can still modify files outside the boundary
- To deactivate, run `/unfreeze` or end the conversation

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone Rasen repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `rasen store list --json` to discover registered store ids and project ids (the `type` field on each entry), then pass `--store <id>` (or `--project <id>` for a project registered via `store add-project`) on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, and the top-level `context`). The `rasen pipeline` inspection group (`pipeline list`, `pipeline show`, `pipeline agents`, `pipeline classify`, `pipeline resume`) also accepts `--store <id>`/`--project <id>` and resolves its root exactly like `validate` — in a store- or project-scoped run you MUST thread the SAME flag onto `pipeline resume <change>` so it reads the change's run-state from that root's change directory, not the cwd. `--store` and `--project` are mutually exclusive on one invocation — pass only one. A store and a project may share the same id (they are separate namespaces); a bare id with neither flag always means the store namespace. Commands outside those two groups do not take either flag — in particular `rasen agent context` (the agent-runtime probe) is NOT the same command as the top-level `rasen context` and does NOT accept `--store`/`--project`; do not paste either flag onto it. Hints printed by commands already carry the right flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store or project flag, commands act on the nearest local `rasen/` root.
