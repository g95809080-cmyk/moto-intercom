Autopilot — drive the full Rasen workflow end-to-end.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone Rasen repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `rasen store list --json` to discover registered store ids and project ids (the `type` field on each entry), then pass `--store <id>` (or `--project <id>` for a project registered via `store add-project`) on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, and the top-level `context`). The `rasen pipeline` inspection group (`pipeline list`, `pipeline show`, `pipeline agents`, `pipeline classify`, `pipeline resume`) also accepts `--store <id>`/`--project <id>` and resolves its root exactly like `validate` — in a store- or project-scoped run you MUST thread the SAME flag onto `pipeline resume <change>` so it reads the change's run-state from that root's change directory, not the cwd. `--store` and `--project` are mutually exclusive on one invocation — pass only one. A store and a project may share the same id (they are separate namespaces); a bare id with neither flag always means the store namespace. Commands outside those two groups do not take either flag — in particular `rasen agent context` (the agent-runtime probe) is NOT the same command as the top-level `rasen context` and does NOT accept `--store`/`--project`; do not paste either flag onto it. Hints printed by commands already carry the right flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store or project flag, commands act on the nearest local `rasen/` root.

You are the **LEAD**. You select a pipeline (default `small-feature`) and drive it by orchestrating role-isolated subagents (you do not do the stage work yourself). You pause at gates and the user can switch to manual at any time.

## When to Use

Use when: "auto", "autopilot", "end to end", "do it all", "one shot".

## 0. Pre-flight context probe (once, non-blocking)

Before anything else run `rasen agent context --latest --json` — it measures YOUR (the LEAD session's) context occupancy from the transcript's recorded API usage. At or above the session handoff threshold (default 0.5; see the playbook's Step H), offer the user a three-way choice: (a) automatic relay now — write the session handoff document and launch a successor session per the playbook's Step H.7; (b) continue this session (auto-compact remains the backstop); (c) handle it manually via /rasen:handoff. Proceed on the user's say-so; below the threshold, proceed silently. Declining leaves behavior exactly as before. Never re-probe on a running loop and never inject a token countdown into the conversation; this is a single entry check, not a meter.

## 0.5. Resolve and record the gate policy (once, before dispatching any stage)

Resolve the effective **gate policy** with precedence **run flag > project config > built-in default**: (1) `--no-gate` present on the invocation -> `off`, source `flag`; else (2) `autopilot.gates: on|off` in `rasen/config.yaml` (read via the project config the same way other config keys resolve) -> that value, source `config`; else (3) `on`, source `default`. Display the resolved policy at run start (e.g. `Gate policy: off (flag)`) so it is visible, never silent. Record it ONCE as `gatePolicy: { effective, source }` in run-state (Step F) at run start — Step D then reads this recorded value for every gate rather than re-deriving it, and **resume reads it back from run-state so the user does NOT re-pass `--no-gate`** on a resumed run. This governs ONLY ordinary gates (`gate: true`); a `gate: 'vet'` stage ALWAYS pauses regardless of policy — see the guardrail below and the playbook's Step D.

## 1. Select the pipeline (explicit wins; default = small-feature)

**Input**: `/rasen:auto [--pipeline <name>] [--review-plan] [--no-gate] [--planner claude|codex] [--implementer claude|codex] [--reviewer claude|codex] [--fixer claude|codex] [--shipper claude|codex] <task description>`.

`--no-gate` makes ordinary gate stages (`gate: true`) auto-approve instead of pausing, for unattended runs — see **step 0.5** below for resolution, recording, and the `vet` exemption.

Choose the pipeline in this order:
1. **Explicit** — if the invocation has `--pipeline <name>`, OR its first token is a known pipeline name from `rasen pipeline list --json` (e.g. `/rasen:auto full-feature 重构鉴权子系统`), use THAT pipeline. Strip the selector token; the rest is the task description.
2. **Default** — otherwise use **`small-feature`** (the default pipeline). Do NOT auto-escalate to full-feature/bug-fix.

You MAY run `rasen pipeline classify "<task>" --json` for a suggestion, or pick any pipeline from `rasen pipeline list` (including project/user-defined ones) — but an explicit selection always wins, and absent one the default is `small-feature`. DISPLAY the chosen pipeline and let the user change it before proceeding.

Built-in pipelines (see `rasen pipeline list --json`):
- **full-feature** — office-hours -> propose -> apply -> parallel expert reviews -> review-loop -> ship -> archive -> retro
- **small-feature** — propose -> apply -> verify -> review-loop -> ship -> archive  _(default)_
- **bug-fix** — propose -> apply -> adaptive verify -> ship -> archive

## 2. Fetch the selected pipeline's stage DAG

Load the chosen pipeline's stages from the registry — do NOT hard-code them:

```bash
rasen pipeline show <name> --json   # -> { name, description, buildOrder, stages }
```

Execute stages in `buildOrder`. Each stage carries the metadata the LEAD interprets via the playbook in section 3: **id**, **kind** (`standard` | `decompose`), **skill** (the Rasen skill the worker invokes; absent for a decompose stage), **childPipeline** (decompose only — the pipeline each child change runs), **role** (worker isolation), **requires** (DAG edges), **gate** (human pause after), **loop** (bounded review->fix), **parallelGroup** (concurrent fan-out — e.g. a `verify` stage's experts), **condition** (run only if met; mutually exclusive conditions like ui / non-ui pick exactly one), **leadReview** (LEAD checks the output for drift — section 4), **verifyPolicy** (section 5).

**Decompose is the conditional FIRST step.** If `buildOrder[0]` is a stage with **kind: decompose** (e.g. the `auto-decompose` pipeline), evaluate run-or-skip from the task BEFORE any other stage — **skip** it and the remaining stages run on one change exactly as today; **take** it and fan the task out into multiple child changes. This is LEAD-audited and proceeds automatically (no human gate); see the playbook's **Step G — Portfolio orchestration**. Pipelines without a decompose first stage are unaffected.

Before running stages, display the effective runtime table and let the user change it:

```
planner=claude|codex  implementer=claude|codex  reviewer=claude|codex  fixer=claude|codex  shipper=claude|codex
```

The user may freely mix runtimes. Example: Codex planner + Codex reviewer + Claude implementer/fixer. Pipeline stages may also set `runtime`, `sessionReuse`, `sandbox`, `model`, and `effort`; invocation role flags override those defaults for this run.

## 3. Execute the pipeline as the LEAD

## Orchestration Playbook — LEAD drives role-isolated subagents

You are the **LEAD**. You orchestrate; you do NOT author WHOLE stage outputs yourself. **Exception:** you MAY apply a **trivial inline fix** per Step E.2 (a one-character typo, an obvious rename) — which is then re-reviewed by a non-author like any other fix; a trivial finding does NOT warrant spawning a separate fixer worker. Anything larger than a trivial inline fix is authored by a dispatched worker, never by you. Each pipeline stage is dispatched to a **leaf worker** subagent that invokes that stage's existing Rasen skill and returns its result to you. Workers never spawn their own subagents — you are the sole orchestrator (flat hierarchy: LEAD + leaf workers).

### Step A — Detect the capability tier (once, at start)

- **Tier A (full):** Claude Code with agent-teams (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`). agent-teams enables `SendMessage` re-engagement of a worker by its **agentId** in general — but it does NOT guarantee a COMPLETED worker is reachable: a completed Agent-tool subagent may not be reliably addressable even within the same un-compacted session (a prior run observed a completed worker unreachable ~27 messages later; the harness directed to "use the agent ID"). So on every dispatch record **agentId** + **transcript** (Step B), re-engage **agentId-first**, and fall back to the transcript warm-seed of Step F.1 when the agentId is absent or does not resolve. Only the LEAD may originate `SendMessage` (that is you); it is within-session only — a worker spawned in a previous session is gone (its agentId is a dead handle after a restart), so crossing a session boundary uses the transcript warm-seed of Step F.1, NOT `SendMessage`.
- **Tier B (no `SendMessage` warm continuation):** Subagent spawning is available but agent-teams is not. Spawn a FRESH worker per stage/round and reconstruct its context from the change directory + run-state (and, when available, the prior worker's recorded transcript — Step F.1).
- **Tier C (degraded fallback):** No subagent capability. Execute the pipeline sequentially in a single context. This is the explicit fallback, NOT the primary path.

Record the detected tier in run-state. The pipeline definition is identical across tiers; only the mechanics below differ.

### Step A.1 — Resolve each agent runtime (Claude or Codex)

Each stage has an effective **runtime**. Resolve it in this order:

1. Per-invocation role overrides from the user, e.g. `--planner codex --reviewer claude --fixer codex`.
2. The registry output from `rasen pipeline show <name> --json`: stage-level `runtime` first, then `agents.<role>`.
3. Default `claude`.

Supported roles are `planner`, `implementer`, `reviewer`, `fixer`, and `shipper`. A single run may freely mix Claude and Codex workers by role or by stage.

Claude workers use the existing Task/subagent path and record `agentId` plus `transcript`. Codex workers are dispatched as non-interactive `codex exec` processes — one per worker, per Step B's Codex prompt shape — and record `threadId` (the durable resume handle, captured from the `--json` event stream) plus the rollout file path as `transcript`. Exec-mode dispatch yields NO turn id; record none — do not invent or promise a `turnId` for Codex workers. Do not store a Codex `threadId` as a Claude `agentId`.

### Step B — Dispatch a stage to a role-isolated worker

For each stage, dispatch a worker of the stage's **role** using the effective runtime from Step A.1.

For a **Claude** stage, spawn a worker and have it invoke the stage's **skill** via the Task tool, e.g.:

> Task tool (subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "You are the <role> for change '<name>'. Use the Skill tool to invoke <skill>. Read rasen/changes/<name>/ for context. <stage-specific instructions>. Return <what the LEAD needs back>. Do only this one unit of work — do NOT spawn subagents of your own; the LEAD owns all orchestration. <handoff clause — Step H.3>")

Every dispatch prompt MUST end with the handoff clause of **Step H.3** (triggers + the structured `DONE`/`HANDOFF` return contract) — a worker that runs out of context mid-stage hands its work to a successor instead of silently degrading. This applies to Codex workers too (the handoff document is runtime-agnostic; `threadId` resume is an optimization on top of it).

Isolation comes from the separate worker context — that is what keeps one stage's noise out of the next. Hand off between stages through the **change directory** (proposal.md, design.md, tasks.md, specs/) for review material, and the **work directory** (review-report.md, ship-log.md, and the rest of the process ephemera set — Step F resolves and defines this location) for process ephemera, never through shared memory. Use `SendMessage` only to continue a conversation with a worker you already spawned (Tier A), not as the inter-stage state channel.

A worker MUST leave its stage's durable artifact before returning — its conversation output alone is NOT a handoff. In particular, the generic expert skills (review / cso / qa / qa-only / benchmark / design-review), when dispatched, run report-only (see their PREAMBLE "Dispatched vs standalone mode") and write their findings — tagged with canonical severities — to the canonical report file in the **work directory** THEMSELVES (Step F's resolved location; sticky-legacy fallback to the change directory), not to their standalone `.rasen/*-reports/` paths: `review-report.md` (code review), `cso-report.md` (security), `qa-report.md` (qa or qa-only), `benchmark-report.md` (performance), `design-review-report.md` (design). The worker that invokes them verifies the report is present before returning. State the target report path in the dispatch prompt's stage-specific instructions. These files are what the resume artifact cross-check, `ship`'s verification pre-flight, and `retro` consume.

For a **Codex** stage, dispatch a leaf worker as a `codex exec` process — the shipped invocation shape (`src/core/codex`'s `buildCodexExecInvocation`), rendered as the shell command you actually run:

```
codex exec --json --output-schema <schema.json> -o <last-message.txt> \
  -s <read-only|workspace-write> -m <model> -c model_reasoning_effort="<effort>" \
  "<inlined template + task prompt + flat-hierarchy guard>" < /dev/null
```

Non-negotiable invariants, not style preferences:

- **Always redirect stdin from `/dev/null`.** `codex exec` blocks forever awaiting EOF otherwise.
- **Always end the prompt with the flat-hierarchy no-delegation guard** (the library's `CODEX_FLAT_HIERARCHY_GUARD` constant — paraphrase it, do not skip it: it tells the worker it is a leaf and must not spawn, delegate, or wait on sub-agents under any circumstances). Codex's native multi-agent system is hierarchical by default and only prompt-level suppression is verified to work.
- **Never dispatch a leaf worker at `ultra` reasoning effort.** `ultra` auto-delegates to sub-agents, which breaks the flat-leaf invariant; use `xhigh` for the hardest leaf work instead.
- **Inline template and skill bodies into the prompt client-side** — never rely on Codex resolving a prompt file on its own (`$CODEX_HOME/prompts`); that path fails silently rather than erroring, so a worker that was supposed to receive a skill body can silently run without it.
- **Constrain worker returns with the structured-return contract.** Write the leaf-return schema (or the evaluate-gate schema, for a goal-loop evaluate dispatch) to a schema file and pass it via `--output-schema`; parse the `-o` last-message file as strict JSON against that schema — do not accept free text as a worker's structured result.

Use `workspace-write` only for artifact-writing roles such as planner or explicitly approved fixing work; use `read-only` for reviewers, leadReview checks, and re-review.

When you spawn a worker, record its identity in run-state (Step F) FROM THE SPAWN RESULT the Agent/Task tool returns: Claude workers record **role**, **agentId**, and **transcript** (the tool's result carries the agentId and the transcript path — copy them verbatim into the stage's `worker` record); Codex workers record **runtime=codex**, **role**, **threadId** (from the `--json` stream's `thread.started` event), **sandbox**/**model**/**effort** as dispatched, and the rollout file path as **transcript**. Exec mode yields NO turn id — record none, never a `turnId`. For Claude, transcript is the cross-session asset. For Codex, threadId is the durable resume handle and transcript (the rollout) is the probe/warm-seed asset. NEVER record a fabricated `name` (the label you passed to the spawn) in place of these handles — `name` is a non-durable dispatch label that is not even in the worker schema, and a name-only record carries nothing a resume can warm-seed from (it is silently dropped from the resume worker set). If the spawn result did not surface a handle, record what you have and flag it for the next dispatch — do not invent one.

### Step B.1 — Persistent planner: propose-only session reuse

**Governed by `reuse.planner`.** Resolve the planner reuse mode from `resolvePipelineReuseConfig(pipeline).planner` via `rasen pipeline show <name> --json` (default `auto` — the same place Step H reads resolved handoff config). Under **`auto`** the persistent-planner rule below applies as today. Under **`never`** do NOT persist a planner: spawn a FRESH planner for each propose, seeded from `planning-context.md` + the sibling proposals already on disk (this is item 2's Tier-B seeding path, promoted to the general `never` path), rather than reusing the prior planner. Everything else in this section describes the `auto` path.

Propose is the ONE exception to fresh-per-stage spawning: under `reuse.planner: auto` a run keeps a SINGLE planner and re-engages it for every propose-stage unit of work (the first change's propose, then every decomposed child's propose). Rationale: proposing is research-heavy — one planner researches the codebase ONCE and amortizes it across all proposals, and a shared planner keeps sibling specs mutually consistent (child #2's planner knows what child #1 promised). All OTHER stages keep fresh role-isolated workers exactly as Step B — do NOT extend this reuse beyond propose. Author != verifier is unaffected: the planner never verifies its own outputs (direction review belongs to the LEAD, leadReview).

1. **Seed once.** Before the first propose, write what YOU already know to `rasen/changes/<name>/planning-context.md` (for a portfolio: the parent's directory): the user's intent verbatim, your codebase findings so far, the decompose plan + dependency rationale, and constraints/decisions already made. The first planner reads this FIRST, then researches only what is missing — not from zero.
2. **Reuse for every subsequent propose.** Tier A: do NOT spawn a new planner — `SendMessage` the SAME planner agentId ("Propose <child-2>. You already hold the codebase research and <child-1>'s proposal; keep the interfaces consistent."). Tier B (no `SendMessage`): spawn fresh but seed it with planning-context.md + the sibling proposals already on disk — still skips most re-research.
3. **Keep the digest current.** Instruct the planner to APPEND durable new findings (decisions, discovered constraints — not chatter) to planning-context.md after each propose, so Tier B re-spawns and post-restart warm-seeds stay cheap.
4. **Record the planner pointer.** Portfolio runs: record the planner's `{role, agentId, transcript}` at the TOP level of `portfolio-run.json` (field `planner`) — it spans children, so a per-change stage record is not enough. Single change: the propose stage's `worker` record (Step F) suffices. After a restart, warm-seed the next planner from this pointer per Step F.1 (`rasen pipeline resume` reports it).
5. **Retire on bloat (deterministic).** A planner that has proposed many children accumulates context. Before EVERY planner re-engagement, apply the Step H.2 warm-continue guard: probe its recorded transcript with `rasen agent context --transcript <path>`; at or above its threshold, retire it — have it write a final handoff document, then seed a fresh planner from that document + planning-context.md and continue the run with the successor (update the recorded pointer). This is a CROSS-CHANGE re-staffing decision, so the threshold it compares against is the resolved **reuse** threshold for the planner (`resolvePipelineReuseConfig(pipeline).roles.planner`, default 0.25) — NOT the handoff threshold that governs mid-task relay; the transcript-probe mechanism is otherwise unchanged.

### Step B.2 — Codex worker lifecycle (resume, death, failure, occupancy, parallelism)

- **Resume.** Re-engage an existing Codex worker with `codex exec resume <threadId> --json --output-schema <schema.json> -o <last-message.txt> -m <model> -c model_reasoning_effort="<effort>" "<message>" < /dev/null` — same capture flags and closed stdin as a fresh dispatch, including `--output-schema` whenever the resume expects a structured return (e.g. a completion-shaped "finish the remaining tasks" nudge still needs the leaf-return/evaluate-gate contract; omit it only for a genuinely free-form conversational nudge) — but with **NO `-s`/`--sandbox`**: sandbox mode is fixed at thread creation and `codex exec resume` rejects the flag outright. If a resume needs a different sandbox, that requires a fresh thread, not a resume call. Always resume by explicit `threadId` — there is no "latest thread" form (racy under parallel dispatch).
- **Death detection.** A Codex thread is dead-in-flight when the rollout's last turn-opening event (`task_started`) has no following turn-closing event (`task_complete` or `turn_aborted`) — this is the real rollout event vocabulary; the dotted `turn.*` names belong to `codex exec --json`'s stdout stream, not the rollout file. A rollout with no opener at all is idle, not dead.
- **Revival.** When re-engaging a thread that died mid-turn, prepend a revival notice to the resume message (the library's `CODEX_REVIVAL_NOTICE` semantics): the interrupted turn's last action may not have completed — do not trust that turn's claims about command or file state, re-verify before continuing.
- **Failure handling.** Classify a failed turn before deciding how to react: a rate-limit failure (429) is retryable — back off and retry starting around 20s, doubling each attempt, capped at 120s; a model-not-available failure (404) is fatal — do not retry, surface it; anything else is unknown — escalate per the Step H.4a worker-death taxonomy rather than guessing.
- **Occupancy.** Probe a Codex worker's context the same way as a Claude worker — `rasen agent context --transcript <rolloutPath> --json` — under the SAME thresholds (Step H); a zero-turn rollout legitimately reads 0% occupancy, that is normal, not an error.
- **Parallel discipline.** Any number of independent `codex exec` processes may run concurrently, each on its own thread — that is safe and verified. NEVER run two concurrent resumes against the SAME thread id: one thread id, one writer, always.

### Step B.3 — Codex project-context guidance

Pass per-change context to a Codex worker by **naming the change directory's artifact paths in the dispatch prompt** (e.g. "Read `rasen/changes/<name>/proposal.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md` before starting") — this is a verified mechanism, workers genuinely read referenced files, not an aspiration. Reserve repo-root `AGENTS.md` for repo-global conventions that apply to every worker regardless of change; it is NOT a per-change context vehicle. Do NOT relocate or `cd` a worker into a change directory to trigger nested `AGENTS.md` auto-discovery as a substitute for naming files explicitly.

### Step C — Enforce author != verifier by role assignment

- The reviewer worker MUST NOT be the implementer worker.
- The fixer of a design-level finding MUST NOT be the original author.
- The worker that re-reviews a fix MUST NOT be the worker that authored the fix.

Under Tier C (single context) the non-author confirmation degrades to an independent gate-run (tests/lint/build) plus a diff-read of the exact change, recorded in run-state and marked as the fallback.

### Step D — Honor stage metadata

- **gate (autopilot-gate-policy):** `gate: true` and `gate: 'vet'` are BOTH pause gates — do not confuse either with the unrelated goal-loop `loop.gate` measure/evaluate union (Step L), which is a stop CONDITION, not a pause. Read the recorded gate policy from run-state (`gatePolicy.effective`, set once at run start per the auto workflow's step 0.5) rather than re-deriving it. **`gate: 'vet'` ALWAYS pauses** — the policy governs ONLY `gate: true` stages, never a `vet` stage; this is the hard safety carve-out and it wins over any policy value. For a `gate: true` stage: policy `on` (default) -> pause exactly as before — summarize what was done and what is next, wait for the human to Continue / Stop (save progress, resumable later) / switch to Manual; policy `off` -> auto-approve without pausing, and record `gateDecision: auto-approved (<source>)` on that stage in run-state (Step F) — the decision is recorded, never silently skipped and never deleted.
- **condition:** If the stage's condition is not met for this change, skip it and record the skip. When a stage lists several MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE conditions (e.g. one expert "or else" another), pick exactly one.
- **parallelGroup:** Run the group's members concurrently and collect every result before proceeding. A single stage MAY itself fan out into a parallel group — e.g. a `verify` stage with `parallelGroup=experts` becomes one reviewer worker per condition-met expert skill (review / cso / benchmark / design-review / qa), all dispatched at once and all results collected before the loop. **Under Tier C** (no subagent capability) run the group's members **sequentially in the single context** and collect all results before proceeding — the concurrency is a Tier-A/B optimization, but the collect-all-results-before-proceeding invariant holds across ALL tiers.
- **loop:** Run the stage as the bounded review->fix loop (Step E).
- **archive stage (archive timing axis):** Read the ship log's RECORDED facts from `workDir` (Step F) before deciding how to run the archive stage — key the decision on what the ship log actually recorded, NEVER on the currently-resolved `archive.timing` (a config value can be edited after the fact; the recorded delivery cannot — same rule as the archive skill's own step 2.5). **Ship log records an `Archived in ship:` line** — ship already ran sync + bookkeeping inside its own stage for THIS delivery; record the archive stage `done`/`skipped` with reason "archived in ship" and dispatch nothing. **No `Archived in ship:` line** (covers every other case: `on-merge` push/local/pr delivery, or no ship log at all) — dispatch the archive stage normally; do NOT pre-branch push/local vs pr here — the archive skill's own steps (1.5 directory scan, 2.5 recorded-Mode branch, 2.6 merge gate) resolve the rest, including the idempotent no-op and the merge-confirmation gate, from the same recorded facts. If the dispatch returns an unmerged refusal (the merge-confirmation gate did not pass), record the stage as `pending` in run-state with an awaiting-merge note (the PR URL) and END the run cleanly, surfacing the open frontier — never poll or busy-wait for the merge. A later `pipeline resume` re-enters the stage and re-attempts the merge check fresh (check-on-invocation); `pending` is already a valid stage status (Step F) — no run-state schema change.
- Pipelines MAY carry additional stage metadata beyond the above (e.g. `leadReview`, `verifyPolicy`); the consuming workflow's own sections define how to handle them.

### Step E — The review -> fix loop (bounded; this is the review-cycle inner loop)

When a stage is a **loop**, narrow on `loop.kind`:

- **`loop.kind === 'review-cycle'`** runs the review -> fix protocol below (Steps 1–5). This is the ONLY loop kind that existed before goal-loop; the steps are unchanged.
- **`loop.kind === 'goal'`** runs the goal-driven iteration loop defined in **Step L** (single dispatch per round, warm-reused implementer, a measure or evaluate gate). Skip Steps 1–5 for a goal loop — they are review-cycle-specific.

**Per-role threshold inside a loop stage.** A loop stage carries a single nominal `role` (e.g. a review-loop stage's `role: fixer`), but it dispatches reviewers, implementers, AND fixers internally. Resolve EACH dispatched worker's handoff threshold by that worker's ACTUAL role — `handoff.roles[<dispatched role>]` (Step H) — NOT by the loop stage's nominal `role`. A reviewer dispatched inside a `review-loop` stage uses the **reviewer** threshold, not the stage's fixer threshold.

For a **review-cycle** loop:

1. **Review** — dispatch reviewer worker(s), delegating each pass to the `rasen-review` engine, over the current diff; collect findings with severity (Blocker / Major / Minor / Trivial). Do NOT fork or reimplement the review heuristics.
2. **Triage by fix size** — trivial (you fix inline) / non-trivial (route to the implementer worker that wrote the code) / design-level (route to a SEPARATE fixer worker, never the author).
3. **Fix** via the routed actor; capture the exact fix delta so re-review can target only the delta.
4. **Re-review the delta with a non-author** — Tier A, same session: resume the original reviewer via `SendMessage` (after the Step H.2 warm-continue guard) to re-review only the delta against its prior findings. Across a session boundary (the original reviewer is gone): warm-seed a fresh reviewer from that reviewer's recorded transcript (Step F.1) so it carries the prior findings, then re-review only the delta. Tier B/C: a fresh reviewer over just the delta, with prior findings + fix diff passed through a shared file. A finding is resolved ONLY after a non-author confirms it; self-certification by the fixer is rejected.
5. **Loop or terminate** — all Blocker/Major resolved (non-author confirmed) -> clean. Resolvable findings remain AND rounds < cap -> next round, re-review the new delta. Cap reached with any unresolved Blocker/Major -> do NOT stop for a human immediately: run the **Step H.5/H.6 escalation ladder** — a LEAD strategy review where each retry changes a material variable (different fix approach, design-level rework via the planner, isolating the stubborn finding), recorded in `strategyAttempts`; only after the strategy budget is exhausted is the stage parked as `escalated` and surfaced at the next natural pause point. Default cap: 3. A review round MAY span multiple worker relays (a fixer that hands off mid-fix is relayed within the same round); the round cap (`loop.maxRounds`) and the relay cap (`maxRelays`) are INDEPENDENT counters — see the counter table in Step H. Never report clean while a Blocker or Major finding is open. Any open Minor/Trivial findings at clean-time MUST be recorded in run-state as accepted-known — never silently dropped.

### Step L — The goal-loop (bounded iteration toward a gate condition)

A `goal` loop drives a task whose "done" is a *condition* — a measurable threshold (measure gate) or a quality judgment (evaluate gate) — not a review-clean diff. It is isomorphic to review-cycle's single-dispatch-per-round shape: ONE implementer dispatch per round, then a gate, then a recorded judgment. Only the LEAD orchestrates; the implementer NEVER spawns child subagents (flat hierarchy).

**Inject (once, before round 1).** Read `goal-plan.md` (produced by the `define-goal` stage's planner) and merge the concrete gate config into `iterate.loopConfig` in run-state: for a `measure` gate assert the `command` is present (it is optional in the pipeline YAML, REQUIRED at run-time) and copy `threshold`/`target`/`direction`/`timeoutSec`; for an `evaluate` gate copy `goal`/`rubric`. The pipeline registers only the gate *type*; the per-task specifics come from goal-plan.md. **Also copy `maxRounds` (and `loopStallLimit` if the planner set it) from goal-plan.md into `iterate.loopConfig`**, so the planner's per-task round cap is honored rather than orphaned by the pipeline/schema default. **Resolve the loop-spine filename once here: `loop.runArtifact` (fallback `goal-run.json`)** — use THAT resolved filename everywhere below that reads or writes the spine, do not hardcode `goal-run.json` when a pipeline configured a different `runArtifact`.

**Each round (single dispatch, warm-reused implementer).**
- **Dispatch the implementer** — warm-reused across ALL rounds (the SAME worker, like review-cycle reuses the fixer thread; rounds do NOT each cost a fresh relay). Tier A: `SendMessage` the same implementer agentId (after the Step H.2 warm-continue guard). Tier B/C: spawn fresh per round seeded from goal-plan.md + the prior round's judgment + the run's handoff documents. Seed: **round 1** = goal-plan.md (no prior score); **round N>1** = goal-plan.md + the prior round's recorded `{score/gaps, measurePassed/evaluateSatisfied}`. The implementer MAY self-run the measure command / self-check informally during its dispatch; the **formal recorded score** is the post-dispatch gate below. Every dispatch prompt ends with the Step H.3 handoff clause and the flat-hierarchy clause (no child subagents).
- **Run the gate (one type, per the pipeline):**
  - **measure** — run `gate.command` (bounded by `timeoutSec`, default 120s), parse stdout JSON `{ score: number, passed?: number, detail?: string }`. Compare `score` against `threshold` using `direction` (`gte` → score ≥ threshold; `lte` → score ≤ threshold), or `passed` against `target` (passed ≥ target). Satisfied when the comparison holds.
  - **evaluate** — dispatch a **FRESH reviewer worker** (≠ the implementer — author ≠ verifier). Hand it `goal` + `rubric` + the artifact under judgment; it MUST return structured `{ satisfied: boolean, gaps: string[] }` (no free text, for reproducibility). Satisfied when `satisfied === true`. **Tier-C fallback (no subagent capability):** Step C's code-gate substitute (tests/lint/build) is meaningless for a subjective rubric, so it does NOT apply here. Instead, author≠verifier degrades to a **second, freshly-reset single-context pass** seeded ONLY with `goal` + `rubric` + the artifact under judgment (NOT the implementation transcript — the reset is what buys independence), recorded in run-state as the Tier-C fallback. If even that reset pass is impossible, **declare goal-loop-evaluate unsupported under Tier C** — NEVER let the implementer self-certify its own rubric.
- **Measure failure branch (no deadlock).** Non-zero exit / timeout / unparseable JSON → record `{round, error: <stderr|timeout|parse>}`, treat the round as NOT passed, and feed the stderr/parse-error as the gap for the next round. The loop never blocks on a broken measure command.

**Record.** Append `{round, score?, measurePassed?, evaluateSatisfied?, detail?, gaps?, error?, gitTreeFingerprint}` to the resolved run artifact (`loop.runArtifact`, fallback `goal-run.json`) in the **work directory** (Step F's resolved location; sticky-legacy fallback to the change root) (`git rev-parse HEAD^{tree}` for `gitTreeFingerprint`). This file is the AUTHORITATIVE loop spine — it survives worker relay. Also mirror the summary into `loopProgress` in run-state (best-effort cache).

**Stop.** Gate satisfied → proceed to the pipeline tail (ship/archive, or report for research). `maxRounds` exhausted → proceed to the tail BUT mark `outcome: maxRounds-exhausted` in the ship-log/report — **never lie about success**. The ship/report stage surfaces the real outcome.

**Stall (gate-neutral).** A round "progresses" if: measure — `score` moved favorably vs the prior round (`gte`: score increased; `lte`: score decreased); evaluate — the gap-set shrank or the gate is newly satisfied. **Round 1 always counts as progress** (no prior to compare). `loopStallLimit` (default 2) consecutive NON-progressing rounds → run the Step H.5 LEAD strategy review: warm-seed a fresh implementer with a different approach, or escalate. Never silently burn rounds on a stuck measure/evaluate.

**Resume (authoritative = the run artifact's last record — `loop.runArtifact`, fallback `goal-run.json`).**
- last record satisfied → go to the tail (do NOT re-run the round).
- last record NOT passed (round complete, has a record) → resume at **lastRound + 1** (fresh dispatch, seeded with the prior gap). NOT "re-run N" — round N already has its recorded judgment.
- no record (define-goal done, iterate died before the first gate) → dispatch round 1.
- Before resuming a round, you MAY re-run the gate once on the current tree (catch a flaky measure command or externally-fixed state); `gitTreeFingerprint` detects tree changes under you — if the tree changed since the last record, the prior judgment may be stale.

**Context / handoff.** The implementer is warm-reused; when its context fills it follows the standard **Step H.3** self-handoff (write a handoff doc, return `HANDOFF { path, reason, completed, remaining }`). The LEAD warm-seeds a successor and the loop continues — `goal-run.json` is the spine that survives the relay. The **research pipeline** sets a lower `handoff.roles.implementer.threshold` (0.35) so relay happens earlier (research is context-heavy); this is the "implementer inline + relay" decision — do NOT use a research-sibling subagent pattern (that violates the flat hierarchy).

### Step F — Maintain run-state (observability + resume)

First resolve TWO locations: run `rasen status --change <name> --json` (or the artifact/apply instructions payload, which also carries it) and read the `changeRoot` field (NOT `changeDir`) — the change's directory under the SELECTED Rasen root, which for a `--store`-selected or non-cwd run is NOT under the current working directory — and the `workDir` field, the external per-change work directory (design capability `change-work-dir`; absent when the project has no machine identity yet — the instructions surfaces mint one on first use).

**Two-location blackboard.** Review material — proposal.md, design.md, tasks.md, specs/, planning-context.md — lives under `changeRoot`; write and read it there, never at a cwd-relative `rasen/changes/<name>/`, or a store-selected run will strand it where a resumer (resolved to the same root) cannot find it. Process ephemera — run-state (auto-run.json / portfolio-run.json / the goal-loop run artifact), handoff documents, and reports — lives under `workDir` instead, external to the repo (it never needs a commit or a gitignore entry).

**Sticky-legacy fallback (states the rule once; every ephemeron path elsewhere in this playbook follows it): read `workDir` first; a file that already exists under `changeRoot` (an in-flight change predating this capability) keeps living there — never split one file's state across both locations; when `workDir` is absent from the payload, read and write everything under `changeRoot`, exactly as before this capability existed.**

Record progress as JSON in `<workDir>/auto-run.json` (sticky-legacy fallback: `<changeRoot>/auto-run.json`). This exact filename + JSON shape is what `rasen pipeline resume` reads — do NOT write markdown or a different name, or resume will not see it; resume reports the directory it actually read as `runStateDir` — write further updates to that SAME directory rather than re-deriving `workDir`. Minimum shape the reader understands:

```json
{
  "pipeline": "small-feature",
  "classification": "small-feature",
  "tier": "A",
  "stages": {
    "propose": { "status": "done", "worker": { "role": "planner", "agentId": "<id>", "transcript": "<project>/<session-id>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl" } },
    "verify":  { "status": "done", "worker": { "role": "reviewer", "agentId": "<id>", "transcript": "<project>/<session-id>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl" } },
    "apply":   {
      "status": "in_progress",
      "worker": { "role": "implementer", "agentId": "<id>" },
      "handoffs": [ { "n": 1, "path": "handoff/implementer-1.md", "reason": "compaction", "completed": ["1.1","1.2"], "remaining": ["1.3"], "at": "<iso>" } ],
      "strategyAttempts": [ { "round": 3, "action": "re-prompt", "rationale": "<why this changes the outcome>", "result": "<what happened>" } ]
    }
  },
  "sessionHandoff": { "n": 1, "path": "handoff/lead-1.md", "pct": 0.52, "afterStage": "apply", "at": "<iso>" },
  "rounds": 0,
  "openFindings": []
}
```

`status` is one of pending | in_progress | done | skipped | escalated; a stage counts as complete for resume only when **done | skipped**. (A simpler `"completed": ["propose","apply"]` array is also accepted when you are not recording per-stage workers.) Record each dispatched worker's **role**, **agentId**, and **transcript** pointer (Step B). Also record review `rounds`, `openFindings`, any skips/escalations, per-stage `handoffs` and `strategyAttempts` (Step H), and the top-level `sessionHandoff` when the session itself hands off. **autopilot-gate-policy:** record the top-level `gatePolicy: { effective: 'on'|'off', source: 'flag'|'config'|'default' }` ONCE at run start (Step D), and a per-stage `gateDecision: "auto-approved (<source>)"` on any stage whose gate was auto-approved rather than confirmed by a human — a human-confirmed gate leaves `gateDecision` unset. `sessionHandoff.n` is the session RELAY GENERATION (the example seeds it at `1`); Step H.7 caps it at `maxRelays`, and a `sessionHandoff` record written WITHOUT `n` reads as generation 1 and never advances — so always carry `n` and increment it each session relay, or the H.7 cap can never trip. Subagent work is otherwise opaque; this record is what lets the run be observed and resumed.

### Step F.1 — Resume a run (cold start: a planned relay OR an unexpected interruption — crash, power loss, socket-close, killed terminal)

A new session has NO live workers — `SendMessage` cannot reach a worker spawned in a previous session (**agentIds are dead handles ONLY across a session boundary — a restart**; WITHIN a live session an agentId MAY still resolve, so re-engagement is **agentId-first** — but a COMPLETED worker is NOT reliably addressable even in-session, whether by its spawn `name` or its agentId, so treat agentId-first as "try it, then fall back to the transcript warm-seed", never a guarantee. This is the H.4a(b) infra-death and H.4b unticked-`DONE` path — and a spawn `name` is a non-durable dispatch label, NOT a resume handle: never rely on it to reach a completed worker). Any request to "resume the worker / resume its session" AFTER an interruption that crossed a session boundary MEANS this ladder: seed a fresh worker from the predecessor's recorded pointers (handoff document, then transcript). Do NOT reverse-engineer the predecessor's progress from artifacts on disk while a pointer exists — artifacts show what survived, but only the ladder carries what the predecessor learned (findings, dead ends, in-flight reasoning). To resume:

1. Run `rasen pipeline resume <name> --json` → it returns `completed`, the next incomplete stage(s) (`next`/`ready`), `remaining`, `workers` (the per-stage `agentId`/`transcript` pointers worth warm-seeding from), and — so nothing is silently stranded — `inProgressStages` (interrupted; re-engage these), `escalatedStages`, and `openFindings` (unresolved Blocker/Major — never ship past them). For a decomposed parent it returns the per-child `runnableChildren` (start fresh), `interruptedChildren` (warm-seed-resume), `escalatedChildren` (human attention), and `completedChildren`. Run-state status is AUTHORITATIVE; artifact presence is a cross-check.
2. **Handoff document first, transcript second.** When run-state records a handoff document for the role you are re-engaging (the stage's `handoffs[]`, or `sessionHandoff` for the LEAD itself), read the DOCUMENT and seed the fresh worker from it — it is the predecessor's own distillation and is cheaper and cleaner than replaying a raw transcript. Fall back to the transcript warm-seed below only when no document exists. A worker that died mid-flight (crash / socket-close) never returned `HANDOFF`, so it has no document — expect an interrupted stage's resume to land directly on the transcript warm-seed (step 3), and go find the transcript BEFORE inspecting artifacts. **Generation-match the distillation:** a handoff/retirement document counts here ONLY if it is the LATEST holder's own distillation of the role's final state. If the role's latest holder died un-exhausted leaving NO document while an EARLIER generation's document exists, resume from the latest holder's TRANSCRIPT (step 3) — an intact latest-generation transcript BEATS any earlier generation's document; never seed a successor from a stale predecessor's document when a newer holder's context survives unrecorded. (Same-session-restart nuance: when the session directory survived the restart, the prior holder's **agentId** MAY still resolve within the live session — try `SendMessage` by **agentId** first, and fall back to this ladder only if no agentId was recorded or it does not resolve. Do NOT rely on the spawn `name` — a completed worker is not reliably name-addressable even in-session.)
3. **Warm-seed, don't cold-restart.** When you must re-engage a prior role (e.g. re-review a fix, or continue an interrupted stage), spawn a FRESH worker of that role and seed it with its predecessor's context: locate that worker's transcript — use the recorded path if present, else GLOB `<claude-projects>/<cwd-as-slug>/**/subagents/agent-<agentId>.jsonl` for the recorded agentId (the `agent-<agentId>.meta.json` sidecar confirms its role) — read it back, extract the relevant prior findings/reasoning, and pass them into the new worker's prompt ("Here is what your predecessor established: …"). The new worker has a new agentId but carries the prior context — functionally a resumed reviewer.
4. **Fallback when the transcript is gone** (pruned / expired / unavailable): cold-reconstruct from the change directory + run-state alone (the Tier B path), and record in run-state that this resume was a cold reconstruction.

Within a SINGLE live session, prefer the cheaper agentId-first `SendMessage` warm continuation (Tier A) when the agentId resolves; the transcript warm-seed is the fallback when it does not, and the only path across a session boundary.

> `SendMessage` and the transcript warm-seed are two routes to the SAME goal — re-engaging a prior worker's context. Within a session, re-engage by **agentId** (NOT by spawn `name`): a completed worker is not reliably name-addressable even in-session, and agentId-first is "try it, then fall back", not a guaranteed revival. When the agentId is absent or does not resolve — or across a session boundary, where agentIds are dead handles — locate the transcript yourself (glob `agent-<agentId>.jsonl`) and seed a fresh worker from it. The difference between the two routes is who finds the transcript and whether the same agentId carries forward — not whether a name works.

### Step G — Portfolio orchestration (the `decompose` fan-out)

A stage with **kind: decompose** is NOT a leaf skill call — it is a fan-out point you, the LEAD, interpret. It is always the pipeline's first stage. Evaluate its `condition` (e.g. `needs-decomposition`) against the task and either **skip** or **take** it:

- **Skip** (single coherent, reviewable slice): record the decompose stage as `skipped` and run the parent's remaining stages on the ONE parent change exactly as a non-decomposed pipeline does. Zero behavior change.
- **Take** (multiple independent deliverables / several distinct capabilities / a scope too large to review as one diff): the parent change becomes a **planning container** — mark its remaining stages `delegated` (do NOT run them at the parent level) and fan out into child changes.

**1. Produce a decomposition plan.** A set of child changes — each an independently-shippable, reviewable slice — plus a **dependency DAG** declaring which children must land before which. Create each child with `rasen new change <child-id>` (name them with a parent-derived prefix, e.g. `<parent>-<slice>`, for traceability).

**2. Self-audit the plan; proceed automatically (no human gate).** Before fanning out, audit your own plan: slice coherence, the independence basis behind any parallel cohort, and DAG correctness. If it is safe, proceed automatically — decompose is NOT a human gate (`gate: false`); do NOT pause for approval. Escalate to the human ONLY when you cannot produce a safe plan (you can neither establish independence NOR find a safe serial ordering). The user may still interrupt at any time, as in any auto run. Optionally you MAY dispatch an independent reviewer worker to audit the plan (author≠verifier) for extra assurance — not required.

**3. Run each child through its childPipeline.** Each child runs the decompose stage's resolved `childPipeline` (default `small-feature`, always decompose-free) via the SAME per-change pipeline machinery (propose → apply → verify → review-loop → …). A child MAY override its pipeline (e.g. one child is `bug-fix` while a sibling is `full-feature`); record each child's actual pipeline in portfolio run-state.

**Child-pipeline gate resolution under portfolio orchestration.** "Proceeds automatically (no human gate)" in item 2 governs the **decompose decision only** — it does not by itself decide how the children's pipeline gates resolve; those resolve per the parent run's gate directive (below). A child's `childPipeline` internal `gate: true` stages resolve per the **parent run's gate directive**: a parent auto run the user launched autonomously (or that resolved decompose without a gate) treats child gates as **auto-continue checkpoints** — RECORD each as taken in portfolio run-state, do NOT pause per child. If the user asked to be gated, collapse the child's gates into ONE per-child checkpoint (not one per gate stage). **Precedence: parent directive > child pipeline `gate`.** `--no-gate` (or a resolved gate policy of `off`) IS a parent directive in this sense: it auto-approves ordinary `gate: true` child gates the same way it does at the parent level, recorded per child in portfolio run-state. **Exception: a child's `gate: 'vet'` stage is NEVER auto-approved by the parent directive** — it always pauses for human confirmation, same as at the parent level (Step D). (This reconciles the auto command's gate-policy wording, which governs a NON-portfolio run, with the decompose autonomy — the 9-pauses literal reading of a 3-child × 3-gate portfolio is explicitly rejected.)

**4. Conservative serial/parallel policy (the safety core).**
- **Dependency edge → strict serial, topological order.** A dependent child's pipeline MUST NOT begin until EVERY prerequisite child is implemented and review-clean (its review-loop passed); never run a prerequisite and its dependent concurrently. A **shared working tree + review-clean is sufficient** for a dependent to consume a prerequisite's code — do NOT force the prerequisite to ship/archive first; escalate to ship/archive only when the dependency is on landed/merged artifacts.
- **Parallel ONLY when all hold:** (1) no dependency edge in either direction, (2) NO overlap in touched capabilities / spec folders / files, and (3) host is **Tier A**. Provably-independent children get separate worker teams and run concurrently with **no fixed cohort cap**. Under Tier B/C, run ALL children serially regardless of independence.
- **Uncertain independence → serial.** Overlapping or ambiguous touch-sets are treated as a dependency. Parallelism requires a *positive* independence proof, never merely the absence of a declared edge — "宁可串行也不能乱并行".

**5. Single portfolio-level delivery.** A child's ship stage runs in **local** delivery mode — commit only; no per-child push, no per-child PR. After ALL children complete, perform ONE portfolio-level delivery at the parent level: resolve the delivery mode there (pr / push) and push or create the PR exactly once. On partial failure, completed children's commits stay local — NEVER push a half-delivered portfolio; escalate with the open frontier.

**6. Recursion guard.** Decompose happens at most once per portfolio, only at the top level. A child's `childPipeline` is decompose-free, so child runs NEVER decompose further.

**7. Portfolio run-state.** Maintain a parent-level record at `<workDir>/portfolio-run.json` (Step F's resolved work directory; sticky-legacy fallback to the change directory): the decomposition plan, child list, dependency DAG (each child's prerequisites), per-child execution mode (serial/parallel) + parallel cohort, per-child pipeline, per-child status, and the current runnable frontier. Each child keeps its OWN per-change `auto-run.json`. The portfolio record is AUTHORITATIVE for resume; child-directory/artifact presence is a cross-check. Resume via `rasen pipeline resume <parent>` (computes the next runnable child(ren) from the DAG). It also reports `interruptedChildren` (were `in_progress` at stop — re-engage via warm-seed, do NOT leave stranded) and `escalatedChildren` (need human attention). On **partial failure** (a child fails or escalates mid-run): stop that child's dependent chain, leave already-complete independent children intact, and escalate with the open frontier.

### Step G.1 — Cross-child implementer reuse (warm-vs-retire)

A dependent child directly consumes its prerequisite's code, so the implementer that just wrote that code is the warmest possible worker for it — but only when it still has the headroom to take on a whole new change. Between a prerequisite child and its dependent, decide reuse-vs-retire (governed by `reuse.implementer`; resolve it and the reuse threshold from `resolvePipelineReuseConfig(pipeline)` via `rasen pipeline show <name> --json`, default `auto` / `0.25`). Under `reuse.implementer: never`, skip this entirely — always spawn a fresh implementer per child.

1. **Relatedness = DAG adjacency.** Reuse is meaningful ONLY across a direct dependency edge (the dependent consumes the prerequisite's code). Independent / parallel-cohort children share nothing to reuse — give them fresh workers.
2. **Probe point = prerequisite review-clean.** Take the reuse decision at the SAME gate that already unblocks the dependent (item 4 of Step G: a dependent MUST NOT begin until every prerequisite is implemented and review-clean), so there is no new synchronization point. Probe the prerequisite implementer's recorded transcript with `rasen agent context --transcript <path>` (the Step F worker pointer). Do NOT probe earlier — non-trivial fixes route back to the implementer, so context keeps growing through the review-fix loop; only the review-clean reading is stable.
3. **Decision (compare to the resolved implementer reuse threshold — `resolvePipelineReuseConfig(pipeline).roles.implementer`).**
   - `pct ≤ threshold` → **warm reuse.** Tier A: `SendMessage` the SAME implementer with the dependent child's dispatch, carrying the **contamination guard** — the prerequisite's conventions hold ONLY where the dependent child's own artifacts (proposal/design) are silent; the worker MUST read the dependent's proposal/design FIRST and treat them as authoritative.
   - `pct > threshold` → **retire-between-children.** The worker's final task is to write a handoff document with reason `retired-between-children`, focused on cross-change-transferable knowledge (conventions, gotchas, dead ends, working set) with an EMPTY `remaining` (the prerequisite is complete — nothing to finish, only knowledge to carry). Then **dual-source seed** a fresh implementer for the dependent child from that document PLUS your own child dispatch brief.
4. **Merge-node rule — unique warm predecessor required.** Reuse requires a SINGLE warm predecessor. A child that depends on more than one prerequisite (a DAG merge node) ALWAYS gets a fresh implementer, multi-source seeded from each prerequisite's durable findings — never inherit any one predecessor's worker at a merge node.
5. **Lineage.** When you reuse (or seed a fresh worker from a retired) predecessor across a child boundary, record `reusedFrom: <prerequisite-child-id>` on the dependent child's implementer worker record in run-state (LEAD-written, single-writer invariant — child-1's frozen field).
6. **Scope guards.** `reuse.implementer: never` → always fresh. The design-level **fixer is excluded from reuse** — its value is fresh eyes, so never warm-reuse a prior worker for a fixer role. Under **Tier B** (no `SendMessage`) or for **Codex** workers, carry the reuse intent through the existing degradation ladders — the transcript warm-seed of Step F.1 for Tier B, `threadId` resume (Step B.2) for Codex — rather than a live continuation; the policy holds across runtimes. When a Codex thread is unresumable (dead beyond revival) or context-poor, fall back further: seed a fresh worker from the prior thread's rollout via warm-seed distillation (final answers deduplicated across sources, commentary-phase messages dropped) instead of resuming. Reuse across a user's manually-run sequence of unrelated changes is an explicit NON-goal (no reliable relatedness signal) — leave that staffing to the user.

### Step H — Context sensing & the handoff protocol

Agents cannot feel their own context usage; they MEASURE it. `rasen agent context` reads exact occupancy from a transcript's recorded API usage — `--latest` probes your own (the LEAD's) main session, `--transcript <path>` probes a worker via the pointer recorded in run-state (Step B). Probe ONLY at the discrete decision points below. NEVER inject a running token countdown into any agent's context — it breaks the prompt-cache prefix and induces premature wrap-up (context anxiety).

Thresholds and caps resolve from the pipeline's `handoff` config: stage-level `handoff` > pipeline `handoff.roles[<role>]` (threshold only) > pipeline `handoff` > built-in defaults `{ threshold: 0.5, maxRelays: 3, stallLimit: 2 }`. `rasen pipeline show <name> --json` reports each stage's resolved values. Context-heavy roles (reviewer, fixer) typically carry higher thresholds — their bootstrap (diff + specs + findings) is expensive, and retiring them too early buys relays that spend most of their window re-loading. When a role keeps hitting its threshold right after bootstrap, the durable fix is better seeding (hand the successor a distilled context pack), not a higher threshold.

**Two threshold families, two decisions.** Which threshold governs a context-occupancy decision depends on WHAT you are deciding:
- A **mid-task relay** ("should this worker keep going on the task in hand?") compares occupancy to the **handoff** threshold (`handoff.roles[<role>]` > `handoff` > default **0.5**).
- A **cross-change re-staffing** decision ("should this worker take on a whole NEW child change?" — persistent-planner reuse per Step B.1.5, cross-child implementer reuse per Step G.1.3) compares occupancy to the **reuse** threshold (`resolvePipelineReuseConfig(pipeline).roles[<role>]`, default **0.25** — stricter/lower, because taking on a fresh change needs more headroom than finishing the current one).

These are different numbers for a reason; do NOT apply the handoff threshold to a reuse decision or vice-versa.

**Counter table — every orchestration counter, what it counts, and its independence.** Several caps share the same default value; they are DISTINCT counters and never share a tally:

| Counter | Counts | Cap (default) | Trigger semantics | Independent of |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **relay count** (`handoffs[]`) | worker HANDOFF relays within one stage | `maxRelays` (3) | **soft** — on the (maxRelays+1)th relay the LEAD reviews (H.5); may continue if progressing | review rounds, goal rounds |
| **review rounds** (`loop.maxRounds`) | review→fix→re-review cycles in a review-cycle loop | `maxRounds` (3) | at cap with open Blocker/Major → strategy ladder (H.5/H.6) | relays (one round MAY span several relays) |
| **strategy attempts** (`strategyAttempts`) | material-change retries after a cap/stall | budget (3) | exhausted → park stage `escalated` | relays, rounds |
| **goal-loop rounds** (goal `maxRounds`) | implementer-dispatch + gate iterations in a goal loop | `maxRounds` (5) | exhausted → tail with `outcome: maxRounds-exhausted` | relays (a warm-reused implementer relays WITHIN a round) |
| **goal stall** (`loopStallLimit`) | consecutive NON-progressing goal ROUNDS | 2 | → Step H.5 strategy review | handoff `stallLimit` (which counts relays) |
| **handoff stall** (`stallLimit`) | consecutive NO-progress RELAYS | 2 | → Step H.5 early review | `loopStallLimit` (which counts rounds) |
| **session relay** (`sessionHandoff.n`) | LEAD session generations | `maxRelays` (3) | **hard** — at `maxRelays`, STOP auto-relay and recommend decompose (H.7) | the worker relay counter |

**`maxRelays` asymmetry (deliberate).** The SAME config value `maxRelays` is a **soft review trigger after N** for worker relays (H.5 — a stuck stage can be re-strategized and continue) but a **hard stop at N** for session relays (H.7 — a session that keeps self-relaying to generation N is the decompose signal). This is intentional, not a bug.

**H.1 Session pre-flight (auto entry).** Once, at the start of an auto run: `rasen agent context --latest --json`. At or above the session threshold, offer the user a three-way choice — (a) **automatic relay now**: write the session handoff document (rasen-handoff template), then launch a successor session per H.7; (b) **continue this session** — auto-compact remains the backstop; (c) **handle it manually** (/rasen:handoff and a fresh session on their own terms). Proceed only on their say-so at that moment; below the threshold, proceed silently. This is an offer, not a gate — the user owns session handoff, and declining leaves behavior exactly as before.

**H.2 Warm-continue guard.** Before EVERY `SendMessage` to an existing worker (delta re-review, planner reuse, any Tier A continuation): probe that worker's recorded transcript. Below its resolved threshold → continue warm (cheapest). At or above → retire it via handoff: make the worker's FINAL `SendMessage` task "write your handoff document (rasen-handoff template) to `<workDir>/handoff/<role>-<n>.md` (sticky-legacy fallback: the change directory)", then spawn a fresh successor seeded from that document (plus planning-context.md for the planner). Seed from the raw transcript only when the document cannot be produced (worker already dead). **Which threshold this guard compares against depends on the decision (per the two-threshold-families rule above):** a mid-task continuation uses the **handoff** threshold, but a **cross-change re-staffing** case — persistent-planner reuse (Step B.1.5) and cross-child implementer reuse (Step G.1.3) — compares against the **reuse** threshold (`resolvePipelineReuseConfig(pipeline).roles[<role>]`, default 0.25, stricter), NOT the handoff threshold. For those two cross-change cases apply the reuse threshold via B.1.5 / G.1.3.

**H.3 Worker self-handoff (the dispatch-prompt clause).** Workers cannot probe themselves mid-run, so every dispatch prompt carries this contract:
- **Triggers**: (a) the soft budget the LEAD stated in the prompt (e.g. "if you complete <m> of <n> tasks and substantial work remains, hand off"); (b) HARD trigger — you notice your earlier conversation has been replaced by a compaction summary: stop starting new work immediately; (c) self-assessment — you can no longer recall details you read earlier.
- **On trigger**: finish or cleanly abort the current atomic step; write `<workDir>/handoff/<role>-<n>.md` (Step F's resolved work directory; sticky-legacy fallback: the change directory) per the rasen-handoff template (the eliminated-hypotheses section is MANDATORY for fixer/debugger roles — it is what stops the successor from re-exploring dead ends); return `HANDOFF { path, reason: compaction|budget|self-assessment, completed: [...], remaining: [...] }` instead of `DONE`.
- **On `DONE` — durable findings.** The normal `DONE` return additionally carries a **durable-findings** clause: 1–3 lines of discoveries that stay true for FUTURE planning (constraints in the code, conventions, gotchas that outlive this task) — not per-task chatter or a status recap. The LEAD relays these findings VERBATIM into the dispatch of the planner that proposes a dependent or subsequent child change (Step B.1), so implementation discoveries feed the next proposal. Every dispatch prompt states this clause so the worker knows to produce it.
- Workers NEVER write run-state — the LEAD does all accounting (single-writer invariant).

**H.4 LEAD accounting on a HANDOFF return.** Append the record to the stage's `handoffs[]` in run-state. Compare `remaining` against the previous relay — progress means tasks completed OR hypotheses eliminated (a fixer that ruled out a hypothesis progressed, even with zero tasks ticked). Below the caps: spawn a successor of the same role seeded with the handoff document + remaining work — same stage, same session; the stage stays `in_progress`.

**H.4a Worker-death taxonomy — triage by WHY it stopped, do not lump into one branch.** A worker that stops WITHOUT a clean `DONE` is classified by the SIGNAL it left, not treated as a single cold-reconstruct case:
- **(a) Context death** — the worker returned `HANDOFF` (compaction / budget / self-assessment) or you observe it hit its context limit. It left (or should have left) a handoff document. → **Relay via the document** (H.3 / F.1), exactly as the accounting above. This is the ONE class that **consumes relay budget** (`handoffs[]`, counts toward `maxRelays` / `stallLimit`).
- **(b) Infra / transient death** — the worker died from an ENVIRONMENT fault (API error, tool timeout, socket close, or it returned nothing) while its transcript is INTACT and you are in the SAME session. This is NOT a context problem. → **FIRST action: `SendMessage` the SAME worker by its recorded agentId (never its spawn `name` — a completed/idle worker is not reliably name-addressable) to revive it** — "You were interrupted by an infrastructure failure, not a context limit. The working directory may have moved; re-read `tasks.md` and run `git status` to re-orient, then continue where you left off." During an overload wave (several workers erroring at once), **back off and retry the wake with increasing delay** rather than stampeding. **Infra revivals consume NEITHER `maxRelays` NOR `stallLimit`** — they are environment hiccups, not progress failures; charging them would spend the decompose budget on transient faults. Only if no agentId was recorded or the wake fails (agentId does not resolve / transcript gone) does this fall back to the transcript warm-seed of step 3 (warm-seed a fresh same-role worker from the intact transcript); only if THAT is impossible does it fall through to (c).
- **(c) Transcript lost** — no live agent AND no recoverable transcript (pruned / expired / cross-session dead handle). → **Cold-reconstruct** the successor from the change-directory blackboard + run-state, and **record the cold reconstruction as a degradation** in run-state. This is the ONLY class that cold-reconstructs.

**H.4b `DONE` with unticked tasks is NOT a death.** A `DONE` return that left some tasks unticked is an ambiguous completion by a worker that is ALIVE and in-session — not any of the three deaths above. → `SendMessage` the SAME worker **by its recorded agentId** ("you left 4.4/4.5 unticked — finish them or explain why they're moot") — do NOT rely on its spawn `name`. Its reasoning is preserved and **no relay is charged**. If no agentId was recorded or it does not resolve, fall back to the transcript warm-seed of Step F.1 step 3 (warm-seed a fresh same-role worker); escalate to (c) cold-reconstruct ONLY if that worker is cross-session / unreachable with no transcript.

**H.5 Relay caps → LEAD review (not a human gate).** On the (maxRelays+1)th handoff request for one stage, or on `stallLimit` consecutive NO-progress relays (this fires early — do not wait for the count cap), STOP relaying and review the history yourself: relays that are progressing may continue past the cap after review; stalled ones need a MATERIAL change. Options, cheapest first: (1) change the approach — re-prompt the successor with a different strategy, or fix the seeding so it stops burning its window on bootstrap; (2) design-level rework — send the problem back to the planner (revise design/tasks, then re-apply the affected part); (3) isolate — split the stubborn remainder into its own task or child change so the main line can move. Record every attempt in the stage's `strategyAttempts` with rationale; a retry that changes nothing material is not an attempt, it is thrash. **Counter scoping:** here `maxRelays` is a **soft** review trigger — a progressing stage may continue past it — whereas for session relays (H.7) the same `maxRelays` is a **hard** stop (the asymmetry noted in the Step H counter table). And for a **goal loop** the relevant stall counter is `loopStallLimit` over ROUNDS (Step L), NOT `stallLimit` over relays — they are independent counters.

**H.6 Strategy budget & non-blocking escalation (shared with Step E's loop termination).** Default budget: 3 strategy attempts per stage. When it is exhausted (or Step E's round cap is hit and the ladder is exhausted): mark the stage `escalated` in run-state with the full relay/strategy/finding history, PARK it, and CONTINUE unblocked work — other portfolio children always; later stages of the same change only when the parked problem does not block them (open Blocker/Major findings block `ship`, per the guardrails). Surface every parked item at the next natural pause — a gate, or the run-end report — as a decision for the human. Never hard-stop the whole run mid-flight for one stuck stage; never report clean while a Blocker/Major is open; never silently pass.

**H.7 Session relay (relaying yourself).** The LEAD can launch its own successor — a verified platform capability (2026-07-07, claude CLI 2.1.202: a session can spawn a new interactive Claude Code window seeded with an initial prompt; the earlier "platform cannot restart the main session" assumption is retired). The mechanics (bootstrap prompt via file indirection or `-EncodedCommand` — bare-quoted prompts get truncated by nested shell parsing; platform spawn commands; manual fallback) live in the rasen-handoff skill's "Session relay" section. The orchestration-level invariants:
- **Quiesce first.** Relay ONLY at a stage boundary: every dispatched worker has returned `DONE`/`HANDOFF` and run-state is persisted. A probe that fires mid-stage waits for the worker's structured return (H.3 covers the worker's own exhaustion) before the handoff-plus-relay sequence. Additionally, before the relay any **held warm reuse candidate** — a worker that returned `DONE` but was RETAINED for a dependent child rather than dismissed (Step G.1) — MUST first write its knowledge digest document — which IS a handoff document: the same rasen-handoff template, written to `<workDir>/handoff/<role>-<n>.md` (sticky-legacy fallback: the change directory) with reason `retired-between-children`, so the successor's document-first resume ladder (F.1) finds it — because its cross-change knowledge would otherwise be lost with its session-scoped agent handle.
- **Spawn after persistence, then stand down.** The handoff document and the `sessionHandoff` record (with generation `n`) hit disk BEFORE the spawn; after the spawn, end the turn and tell the user the predecessor window can be closed — never keep orchestrating from the predecessor.
- **Generation cap.** `sessionHandoff.n` at `maxRelays` (resolved config, default 3) stops auto-relay: present the relay history and recommend decomposing the change (Step G) — repeated session relays are the decompose signal, same as worker relays (H.5).
- **No cross-session worker resurrection.** The successor never addresses the predecessor's workers (dead agentIds); it re-creates what it needs via the Step F.1 ladder — handoff document first, recorded transcript second, change-directory cold reconstruction last.
- **Codex workers are unaffected by a LEAD session relay.** A session relay is a Claude-LEAD mechanism only — Codex worker threads are not tied to the LEAD's session, so the successor LEAD simply resumes their recorded `threadId`s (Step B.2) exactly as it would mid-session; nothing about the relay itself touches Codex state. (If the LEAD role itself ever inverts to run on Codex, `codex resume [SESSION_ID] [PROMPT]` and `codex fork --last` are the candidate primitives for that future mechanism — named here only, not designed.)

## 4. Propose direction-review gate (optional)

When the `propose` stage has **leadReview** enabled (via the `--review-plan` argument or the stage flag): after the propose worker returns and BEFORE `apply`, you (the LEAD) review proposal.md / design.md / specs / tasks.md against the user's ORIGINAL intent for direction drift. You hold the original intent and did NOT author the proposal, so this is a legitimate non-author check.
- Aligned -> continue to apply.
- Drifted -> bounce back to a fresh planner worker with the drift notes, or surface it to the user at the gate.
- **Tier C exception:** under the single-context fallback the LEAD itself authored the proposal, so leadReview would be a self-review. There, do NOT count it as a non-author check — degrade it to an explicit human-confirmation gate before apply, and record it as a fallback in run-state.
When leadReview is not enabled, proceed from propose to the next stage without the extra review.

## 5. verify stage — verifyPolicy semantics

A `verify` stage carries a **verifyPolicy** of `adaptive` (default), `standard`, or `light`. Every value has defined behavior — none is dead config:

**`adaptive` (default) — scale the verification passes to the diff size:**
- Run the unit-test gate first. Record the gate's command, result, and the content tree fingerprint (`git rev-parse HEAD^{tree}`) of the git state it ran against in run-state — the ship stage's evidence-based test gate consumes this to decide whether tests must be re-run.
- **Simple** fix (single file / non-core path / tests sufficient) AND tests green -> verify passes; skip the review loop.
- **Complex** fix (multiple files / core paths / insufficient coverage) -> spawn a dedicated test/verification worker for deeper checking AND enter the review-cycle loop.
- Compute the simple/complex determination from the diff and record it in run-state.

**`standard` — a single verify pass, no review-cycle loop.** Run the verify worker once over the diff, record its verdict + the test-gate evidence (command/result/tree fingerprint) as under `adaptive`, and proceed on a clean verdict; do NOT enter the bounded review->fix loop. Open Blocker/Major findings still block `ship` (escalate per Step H) — "no loop" narrows the passes, it does not waive the finding-gate.

**`light` — skip verification when the diff is trivial** (e.g. docs-only or tests-only, no product-source change). Record the skip and its basis (the trivial-diff determination) in run-state. If the diff is NOT trivial, do not honor `light` — fall back to `standard` and note the fallback, so a mis-tagged non-trivial change is never shipped unverified.

## Resume

On invocation for an existing change, determine the next incomplete stage from the change's run-state AND artifacts via `rasen pipeline resume <change> --json`, then resume from there rather than restarting. If the run is store- or project-scoped (the change lives in a `--store`- or `--project`-selected Rasen root), thread the SAME flag onto resume — `rasen pipeline resume <change> --store <id> --json` (or `--project <id>`) — so it resolves that root and reads run-state from its change directory; omitting it would resolve the cwd root and report `hasRunState:false` for a change that is actually mid-run. The run-state per-stage status is AUTHORITATIVE; artifact presence is a heuristic to seed or cross-check it, and run-state wins on any conflict. Artifact signals: office-hours-design.md -> office-hours done; proposal.md -> propose done; tasks.md all checked -> apply done; review-report.md (or any expert `*-report.md` — the verify worker saves these per the playbook's Step B) -> verify done; review-cycle-report.md -> review-loop done; ship-log.md -> ship done; change moved to archive -> archive done; retro.md -> retro done. If neither run-state nor any artifact exists yet, start from the pipeline's first stage.

A fresh session has no live workers, so `SendMessage` cannot reach a worker from a prior session (agentIds are dead handles across a session boundary). Re-engagement is **agentId-first** within a live session — but a completed worker is NOT reliably name-addressable even in-session, so do NOT rely on a spawn `name`; fall back to the transcript warm-seed of the playbook's **Step F.1** when the agentId is absent or does not resolve. When you must re-engage a role on resume (e.g. the reviewer for a re-review, or an interrupted stage), **warm-seed** a fresh same-role worker from its predecessor's recorded transcript. `rasen pipeline resume` reports the per-stage `workers` pointers (agentId / transcript) available to seed from; fall back to cold reconstruction from the change directory when a transcript is gone.

**Portfolio resume.** If the change is a decomposed parent (it has a `portfolio-run.json`), `rasen pipeline resume <parent> --json` returns `isPortfolio: true` with the child list, each child's status, and the **runnable frontier** (thread `--store <id>` or `--project <id>` here too for a store- or project-scoped run, same as above). Resume the portfolio — continue incomplete children in dependency order and do NOT re-run completed ones — rather than re-running decompose. The portfolio record is authoritative; each child's own `auto-run.json` resumes that child's inner pipeline. It also returns the run-level `planner` pointer (the persistent planner that spans all children's proposes — playbook Step B.1): warm-seed the next planner from it plus `planning-context.md` instead of starting propose research from zero.

## Guardrails

- Gate stages pause for human confirmation UNLESS the resolved gate policy (step 0.5) is `off`, in which case an ordinary `gate: true` stage is auto-approved and the approval is recorded in run-state (`gateDecision: auto-approved (<source>)`) — never silently skipped, never deleted from the record. A `gate: 'vet'` stage is the hard exception: it ALWAYS pauses for human confirmation, even under `--no-gate` or `autopilot.gates: off` — never rationalize skipping it. (For a decomposed portfolio's child-pipeline gates, this resolves per the playbook's Step G child-gate semantics: parent directive > child gate, with the same `vet` exception carrying through to child gates.)
- If a stage is stuck (relay caps, stalled handoffs, exhausted review rounds), run the playbook's Step H escalation ladder — LEAD strategy review first, then park the stage as `escalated` and continue unblocked work; surface parked items at the next gate or the run-end report. Hard-stop only on failures the ladder cannot express (e.g. corrupted state).
- The user can interrupt at any time and switch to manual.
- Save run-state so the pipeline can be resumed from where it left off.
- Do not run `ship` if verification has unresolved Blocker/Major findings — escalate first.
- Enforce author != verifier across stages (reviewer != implementer; design-level fixer != author; re-reviewer != fixer).
- Decompose is LEAD-audited, not a human gate — proceed automatically once the plan is safe; escalate only when no safe plan exists. The user can still interrupt.
- NEVER parallelize children you cannot prove are independent: parallel requires no dependency edge AND no overlapping touched capabilities/specs/files AND Tier A. When uncertain, run serial. Never parallelize under Tier B/C.
- A dependent child waits for every prerequisite to be implemented + review-clean before it starts; a shared working tree is sufficient (no forced ship/archive of the prerequisite unless the dependency is on landed/merged artifacts).
- Decomposed children ship in **local** delivery mode (commit only — no per-child push or PR). The portfolio delivers ONCE: after ALL children complete, resolve the delivery mode at the parent level and push / create the PR there. On partial failure, completed children's commits stay local — never push a half-delivered portfolio.
- Save portfolio run-state (`portfolio-run.json`, in the resolved work directory per the playbook's Step G.7 — change-directory fallback) so a decomposed run is observable and resumable; on a child's failure, stop its dependent chain, keep independent done children, and escalate with the open frontier.
