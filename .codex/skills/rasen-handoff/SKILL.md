Write a handoff document — distill the current working context so a fresh agent can continue without replaying this conversation.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone Rasen repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `rasen store list --json` to discover registered store ids and project ids (the `type` field on each entry), then pass `--store <id>` (or `--project <id>` for a project registered via `store add-project`) on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, and the top-level `context`). The `rasen pipeline` inspection group (`pipeline list`, `pipeline show`, `pipeline agents`, `pipeline classify`, `pipeline resume`) also accepts `--store <id>`/`--project <id>` and resolves its root exactly like `validate` — in a store- or project-scoped run you MUST thread the SAME flag onto `pipeline resume <change>` so it reads the change's run-state from that root's change directory, not the cwd. `--store` and `--project` are mutually exclusive on one invocation — pass only one. A store and a project may share the same id (they are separate namespaces); a bare id with neither flag always means the store namespace. Commands outside those two groups do not take either flag — in particular `rasen agent context` (the agent-runtime probe) is NOT the same command as the top-level `rasen context` and does NOT accept `--store`/`--project`; do not paste either flag onto it. Hints printed by commands already carry the right flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store or project flag, commands act on the nearest local `rasen/` root.

Context-window occupancy is measured, never guessed: `rasen agent context --latest` reads the exact API usage from the session transcript (`--transcript <path>` probes a specific worker transcript instead). The handoff document is a DISTILLATION CHECKPOINT on top of the change-directory blackboard, not a replacement for it — tasks.md ticks and on-disk artifacts stay the primary state; the document carries only what the blackboard cannot record.

## When to Use

Use when: "handoff", "交接", context usage is high and a fresh session is planned, before intentionally ending a long session mid-change, or when the orchestration playbook directs a worker to hand off mid-stage.

## Session-level flow (the default when a user invokes this)

1. **Probe first.** Run `rasen agent context --latest --json` and report `{ contextTokens, limit, pct }` to the user. This is informational — the user decides; do not refuse to hand off below any threshold.
2. **Select the change.** Use the active change being driven (infer from conversation / `rasen list --json`; prompt only if genuinely ambiguous). If no change is active, write the document to `rasen/handoff/<topic-slug>.md` instead and skip the run-state update (this repo-level fallback has no change scope and is unaffected by the rest of this section). Otherwise resolve `workDir` from `rasen status --change <name> --json`: process ephemera below is written there, falling back to the change directory when `workDir` is absent or the file already lives there (sticky-legacy).
3. **Write the document** to `<workDir>/handoff/lead-<n>.md` (fallback: `rasen/changes/<name>/handoff/lead-<n>.md`) where `<n>` is 1 + the highest existing lead-* number (never overwrite a predecessor). Use the template below.
4. **Update run-state** (`<workDir>/auto-run.json`, fallback: `rasen/changes/<name>/auto-run.json`): set top-level `sessionHandoff` to `{ "path": "handoff/lead-<n>.md", "n": <n>, "pct": <probe pct>, "afterStage": "<last completed stage>", "at": "<ISO timestamp>" }` — `n` is the relay generation and matches the document number (a record without `n` reads as generation 1). Create the file with just that field if no run-state exists yet.
5. **Offer to relay** (below the cap — see Session relay): ask whether to launch the successor session now. On yes, follow the Session relay protocol. On no — or when the generation cap is reached — fall back to manual resume:
6. **Tell the user how to resume manually**: start a fresh session and run `/rasen:auto <change>` (or `rasen pipeline resume <change> --json` manually) — resume reports the sessionHandoff pointer and the new LEAD reads the document FIRST, before any transcript warm-seeding.

## Session relay (launching the successor yourself)

With the user's authorization you can launch the successor instead of asking them to open a new session. Preconditions: the handoff document AND the run-state update are already on disk (spawn strictly after both), and no worker is in flight (stage boundary — every dispatched worker has returned `DONE`/`HANDOFF`).

**Generation cap.** Before spawning, check the generation: if the new document's `n` has reached `maxRelays` (the pipeline's resolved handoff config via `rasen pipeline show <pipeline> --json`, default 3), do NOT auto-spawn. Present the relay history (`handoff/lead-*.md`) and recommend decomposing the change instead — repeated session relays signal work that should be split, not relayed harder.

**Bootstrap prompt — file indirection, never bare quoting.** Write the successor's first instruction to `<workDir>/handoff/relay-prompt.txt` (fallback: `rasen/changes/<name>/handoff/relay-prompt.txt`):

```
You are the successor session (generation <n+1>) for change <name>.
1. Read your predecessor's distillate at the handoff path reported above (lead-<n>.md); do not re-litigate its decisions.
2. Run: rasen pipeline resume <name> --json   (add --store <id> if the change lives in a store, or --project <id> if it lives in a project)
3. Continue from the document's "Next action". Workers from the previous session are gone (dead agentIds) — re-create any you need via the resume ladder (handoff doc, then recorded transcript, then change directory).
```

NEVER inline the prompt into the spawn command as a bare quoted string: nested shell parsing strips the quotes and the successor receives only the text up to the first space (observed live — a non-ASCII prompt truncated to its first two characters). The file is the platform-neutral channel; on Windows, PowerShell `-EncodedCommand` (base64) is an equally safe shortcut.

**Spawn a visible interactive window** (never headless — the user must be able to watch and take over), from the project root:

- Windows (verified): build the command string `claude "$(Get-Content -Raw '<abs path to relay-prompt.txt>')"`, base64-encode it (`[Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($cmd))`), then `Start-Process powershell -WorkingDirectory '<project root>' -ArgumentList '-NoProfile','-NoExit','-EncodedCommand',$enc`.
- macOS: write a small executable `relay.command` script containing `cd '<project root>' && claude "$(cat '<abs path to relay-prompt.txt>')"`, then `open relay.command`.
- Linux: `gnome-terminal -- bash -lc 'cd <project root> && claude "$(cat <abs path>)"'` (or `konsole -e` with the same body).

**Fallback is always manual.** If the terminal form is unknown or the spawn errors, print the project root, the relay-prompt file path, and the exact launch command for the user to run themselves — never retry headless.

**After the spawn**, end your turn: tell the user the successor window is up and this session can be closed. Do not keep working in the predecessor.

## Worker-level use (directed by the orchestration playbook)

A worker told to hand off mid-stage writes `<workDir>/handoff/<role>-<n>.md` (fallback: `rasen/changes/<name>/handoff/<role>-<n>.md`) with the same template, then returns the structured `HANDOFF` result to the LEAD. Workers NEVER update run-state — the LEAD does that accounting (single-writer invariant).

**Retired between child changes (`retired-between-children`).** When the orchestration playbook retires a warm worker BETWEEN dependent child changes (a cross-change re-staffing, not a mid-stage exhaustion) rather than reusing it, that worker writes the SAME document with reason `retired-between-children`, but its content focus shifts from "resume this task" to "transfer cross-change knowledge": lead with **Key decisions**, **Dead ends & gotchas**, and **Working set** — the conventions and traps the successor on the dependent child inherits — and leave **Remaining** empty (the change is complete; there is nothing to finish, only knowledge to carry forward). The template is unchanged — only the emphasis differs. The successor implementer on the dependent child is then dual-source seeded from this document plus the LEAD's dispatch brief. This `retired-between-children` document is also what the session-relay quiesce rule calls a held warm reuse candidate's **knowledge digest** — the same file, written before any session relay so the worker's cross-change knowledge survives the boundary.

## Handoff document template

```markdown
# Handoff: <change> — <role> #<n>

## Original intent
<What the user actually asked for, verbatim where it matters — not "what I was doing".>

## Position
Pipeline: <name>. Completed stages: <...>. Current stage: <id> (<what part of it>).

## Done / Remaining
Done: <task ids/short labels — reference tasks.md, do not copy it>.
Remaining: <task ids + anything discovered that tasks.md does not list>.

## Key decisions (and why)
- <decision> — <rationale; the successor must not re-litigate or silently reverse these>

## Dead ends & gotchas
- <approach tried and abandoned — why; traps in the code/tooling that cost time>

## Eliminated hypotheses (MANDATORY for fixer/debugger roles)
- <hypothesis> — ruled out by <evidence>. Current best hypothesis: <...>.

## Working set
<Files touched / mid-edit; commands or test invocations that matter.>

## Next action
<The single concrete first step the successor should take.>
```

Sections with nothing to say state "none" rather than being dropped — an explicit "no dead ends" is information. Write for a reader with ZERO shared context: no conversation shorthand, no unexplained labels.

## Guardrails

- Never overwrite an existing handoff document; numbering is append-only.
- The document must not contradict the blackboard — if tasks.md is stale, fix tasks.md rather than describing the divergence.
- Do not paste large code/diff bodies into the document; point at files and line ranges instead.
- Relay only with user authorization, only below the generation cap, and only after the document and run-state are on disk; bootstrap prompts travel via file indirection or `-EncodedCommand`, never bare quoted strings.
