Archive a completed change in the experimental workflow.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone Rasen repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `rasen store list --json` to discover registered store ids and project ids (the `type` field on each entry), then pass `--store <id>` (or `--project <id>` for a project registered via `store add-project`) on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, and the top-level `context`). The `rasen pipeline` inspection group (`pipeline list`, `pipeline show`, `pipeline agents`, `pipeline classify`, `pipeline resume`) also accepts `--store <id>`/`--project <id>` and resolves its root exactly like `validate` — in a store- or project-scoped run you MUST thread the SAME flag onto `pipeline resume <change>` so it reads the change's run-state from that root's change directory, not the cwd. `--store` and `--project` are mutually exclusive on one invocation — pass only one. A store and a project may share the same id (they are separate namespaces); a bare id with neither flag always means the store namespace. Commands outside those two groups do not take either flag — in particular `rasen agent context` (the agent-runtime probe) is NOT the same command as the top-level `rasen context` and does NOT accept `--store`/`--project`; do not paste either flag onto it. Hints printed by commands already carry the right flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store or project flag, commands act on the nearest local `rasen/` root.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run `rasen list --json` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

   Show only active changes (not already archived).
   Include the schema used for each change if available.

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

1.5. **Check for a prior archive across every destination (NEW — before the status call, which requires the change directory to still exist)**

   Run `rasen list --json` (reuse step 1's call if it already ran) and take `root.path` from its payload — this gives `<root.path>/rasen/changes` as `changesDir` without needing a successful status call.

   **First, check whether `<changesDir>/<name>` still EXISTS as an active directory.** If it does, this step's archive scan does NOT apply — SKIP the rest of this step and proceed to step 2 normally. A currently-active directory means this name is not currently archived; it may also be a NEW change reusing a previously-archived name (see the recycled-name note below) — either way, an active directory always means "go to step 2", never "treat as already archived".

   **Only when `<changesDir>/<name>` does NOT exist**, scan every destination the `archive-destination` axis allows — a config flip never migrates a prior archive, so re-invoking archive on an already-archived change must recognize wherever it actually landed, using directory presence and recorded facts (ground truth) rather than a status call, which would THROW "not found" for a change whose directory has already moved or been deleted:

   a. **In-repo scan** (no CLI call needed): check whether `<changesDir>/archive/` contains a directory matching `YYYY-MM-DD-<name>` — the date prefix is unknown so match the pattern, but the segment AFTER the date must equal `<name>` EXACTLY (not merely end with it), to avoid a suffix collision with a differently-named change.
   - **A match exists** → report the change as already archived at the matched path and STOP cleanly — do NOT call `rasen status` for this name; skip every remaining step (gates, sync, move).
   - **No match** → continue to (b); nothing has archived this change in-repo under this name (yet).

   b. **External scan and ship-log tombstone** (only reached when (a) found nothing): run `rasen context --json` and read `root.machineHome` — this resolves without the change directory needing to exist, unlike status. When `machineHome` is present, check `<machineHome>/archive/` for a `YYYY-MM-DD-<name>` match under the same rule as (a); if none, read `<machineHome>/changes/<name>/work/ship-log.md` (the frozen work-directory layout, consulted directly here — the one exception to always resolving `workDir` from a status payload, because no status payload can exist for a change whose directory is already gone) for an `Archived in ship:` or `Pruned:` line.
   - **Archive-directory match, or a tombstone line, found** → report the recorded outcome (the matched external path, or the pruned state) and STOP cleanly — skip step 2 and every remaining step.
   - **No `machineHome` (project never registered), or nothing found anywhere** → proceed to step 2 normally; if the change genuinely does not exist under any known name or location, status's own "not found" error surfaces there for human triage.

   **Recycled-name note:** a NEW change may reuse a name that a PRIOR (now-archived) change also used. The active-directory check above correctly routes such a name's new incarnation to step 2 (it is active, so the scan above is skipped) — but its `workDir` is keyed by change NAME, so it may still hold the PRIOR incarnation's ship log, carrying a stale `Archived in ship:` or `Pruned:` marker. That stale marker trips step 2.5's inconsistency HARD STOP later; this is loud and safe (it never silently mis-archives), but tell the human what it actually means — "a prior change with this same name was archived-in-ship (or pruned); this ship log is stale and belongs to that earlier change" — not a generic directory-move inconsistency.

2. **Check artifact completion status**

   Run `rasen status --change "<name>" --json` to check artifact completion.

   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used
   - `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, `artifactPaths`, and `actionContext`: path and scope context
   - `artifacts`: List of artifacts with their status (`done` or other)

   **If any artifacts are not `done`:**
   - Display warning listing incomplete artifacts
   - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to confirm user wants to proceed
   - Proceed if user confirms

2.5. **Check the ship log's recorded delivery mode (gate on RECORDED facts, never on re-resolved config)**

   Read `ship-log.md` from the work directory (`workDir` from status JSON; fall back to the change directory — `changeRoot` — when `workDir` is absent or the file already lives there), if it exists. Reaching this step already means step 1.5 found no archived directory for this name, so branch on what the ship log itself recorded — NOT on the currently-resolved `archive.timing` (a config value edited after the fact must never reinterpret what already happened; `archive.timing` is consulted only for decisions not yet taken):
   - **No ship log exists** → proceed straight to step 3; nothing was recorded to gate on.
   - **Ship log exists and its `Archived in ship:` line IS present** → inconsistency: step 1.5's directory scan should already have caught this. Reaching here means the log claims an in-ship archive but the directory scan found nothing at the expected location (a partial/failed move, or a non-standard archive location) — do NOT proceed automatically. HARD STOP: surface the inconsistency for human triage (do not sync or move; do not silently treat it as either archived or not).
   - **Ship log exists and its `Pruned:` line IS present** → the same class of inconsistency: step 1.5b's tombstone scan should already have caught this and stopped before reaching step 2 at all. Reaching here means the log claims the change was pruned but step 1.5b missed it (a stale probe, a corrupted registry, or the recycled-name situation below). HARD STOP: surface the inconsistency for human triage — do NOT proceed, do NOT delete, do NOT silently treat it as either pruned or not.
   - **Ship log exists, no `Archived in ship:` line, and its `Mode:` line is `pr`** → run the merge-confirmation gate (step 2.6) before continuing to step 3. This applies regardless of the currently-resolved `archive.timing` — a recorded `pr` delivery always needs its merge verified before archiving, whether the axis is `on-merge` or was later flipped.
   - **Ship log exists, no `Archived in ship:` line, and its `Mode:` line is `push` or `local`** → proceed straight to step 3; there is no PR to verify.
   - **Ship log exists, no `Archived in ship:` line, `Mode:` line missing or unparseable, but a `PR:` URL IS present** → treat as a recorded `pr`-mode delivery (a PR URL only makes sense for a pr-mode ship) and run the merge-confirmation gate (step 2.6), same as the `Mode: pr` branch — closes the gap where a malformed log missing `Mode:` would otherwise skip the gate.
   - **Ship log exists, no `Archived in ship:` line, and NEITHER a parseable `Mode:` line NOR a `PR:` URL is present** → treat as nothing recorded; proceed straight to step 3, same as the no-ship-log case — there is nothing to gate on.

2.6. **Merge-confirmation gate (recorded `pr`-mode delivery only)**

   Extract the PR URL from the ship log's `PR:` field and run `gh pr view <url> --json state,mergedAt`.
   - **`MERGED`** → proceed to step 3.
   - **`OPEN`** → HARD GATE: REFUSE to archive by default with a message naming the unmerged PR. Proceed ONLY on an explicit override that names the unmerged condition (not the routine confirm). REFUSE outright in a non-interactive / dispatched context.
   - **`CLOSED` without a merge** → HARD GATE: REFUSE and surface the rejected-delivery state for human decision — a rejected PR must never silently become an archived change.
   - **Cannot verify** (`gh` missing/unauthenticated, network failure, unparseable output, or no PR URL in the ship log) → state that the merge cannot be verified and ask the human to explicitly confirm the merge; proceed ONLY on that explicit confirmation in an interactive context. REFUSE outright with the reason in a non-interactive / dispatched context, leaving the archive re-attemptable later. An unverifiable state is NEVER treated as merged.

   This is a check-on-invocation only — no polling, no background process. The CLI never shells to `gh`/git for this; the check runs agent-side.

3. **Check task completion status (HARD GATE)**

   Read the tasks file from `artifactPaths.tasks.existingOutputPaths` (in the status JSON fetched in step 2) to check for incomplete tasks — resolve it from the CLI rather than assuming a repo-local `tasks.md` (the tasks artifact is not always literally `tasks.md`), matching `rasen-bulk-archive-change`.

   Count tasks marked with `- [ ]` (incomplete) vs `- [x]` (complete).

   **If incomplete tasks found — this is a HARD GATE (aligned with verify's "must fix before archive"):**
   - Display the count of incomplete tasks and REFUSE to archive by default.
   - Proceed ONLY on an explicit override that NAMES the incomplete-task condition (e.g. the user selects "Archive anyway despite N incomplete tasks") — not the routine confirm.
   - In a non-interactive / dispatched context, REFUSE outright — do not auto-confirm.

   **If no tasks file exists:** Proceed without task-related warning.

3.5. **Check verification verdict (HARD GATE)**

   Read `verification-report.md` from the work directory (`workDir` from status JSON; fall back to the change directory — `changeRoot` — when `workDir` is absent or the file already lives there) when it exists, and honor its `VERIFY VERDICT:` line (written by `/rasen:verify` — capability `verify-ship-evidence`; do NOT invent new verdict words).
   - `VERIFY VERDICT: BLOCKED` → HARD GATE: REFUSE to archive by default; proceed only on an explicit, blocker-naming user override (e.g. "Archive anyway despite BLOCKED verification"); REFUSE outright non-interactively.
   - `VERIFY VERDICT: CLEAN` → no verification-related gate; proceed.
   - No `verification-report.md` → do NOT hard-gate on verification absence (a change may legitimately archive without a formal verify pass); a soft note at most.

3.6. **Check delivery precondition (soft)**

   Read `ship-log.md` from the work directory (`workDir` from status JSON; fall back to the change directory — `changeRoot` — when `workDir` is absent or the file already lives there):
   - **Absent** → soft-warn "This change has no ship log — archive without delivering?" with an explicit escape for changes that legitimately do not ship (e.g. spec-only); proceed on confirm.
   - **Present and its `Status:` line contains "delivery deferred to portfolio level"** (the marker ship writes in local mode) → soft note that parent-level portfolio delivery is still pending and archiving the child now may lose track of it; confirm to proceed. Minimal cross-reference only — no portfolio graph or parent lookup.
   - **Present and delivery completed** (PR created / branch pushed) → proceed without a delivery warning.

4. **Assess delta spec sync state**

   Use `artifactPaths.specs.existingOutputPaths` from status JSON to check for delta specs. If none exist, proceed without sync prompt.

   **If delta specs exist:**
   - Compare each delta spec with its corresponding main spec, resolved under the `specs/` directory that is the sibling of `planningHome.changesDir` (from the status JSON in step 2), NOT a literal repo-relative `rasen/specs/<capability>/spec.md` — in a registered store this resolves to the store's specs
   - Determine what changes would be applied (adds, modifications, removals, renames)
   - Show a combined summary before prompting

   **Prompt options:**
   - If changes needed: "Sync now (recommended)", "Archive without syncing"
   - If already synced: "Archive now", "Sync anyway", "Cancel"

   If user chooses sync, use Task tool (subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "Use Skill tool to invoke rasen-sync-specs for change '<name>'. Delta spec analysis: <include the analyzed delta spec summary>"). Proceed to archive regardless of choice.

5. **Perform the archive (destination-aware)**

   Resolve the destination and location from the status JSON fetched in step 2: `archive.destination` (`in-repo` | `external` | `prune`) and `archive.archiveDir` (absolute; always present for `in-repo`, present for `external` only when it resolves, absent for `prune`).

   **Destructive-destination preconditions (`external` and `prune` only)** — both remove the repository's only copy of this change's review material, so verify BEFORE moving or deleting anything:
   - Delivery is complete per the gates already run in steps 2.5/2.6 (a recorded `pr`-mode delivery must have already passed the merge-confirmation gate to reach this step at all).
   - The change directory must be CLEAN AND TRACKED — a plain `git status --porcelain` is NOT sufficient on its own, because ignored files are invisible to it (a change directory covered by `.gitignore` would read as "clean" even though nothing in it was ever committed): run `git status --porcelain --ignored -- <changeRoot>` and require it to be empty (catches uncommitted, untracked, AND ignored-but-present content), AND run `git ls-files -- <changeRoot>` and require it to be NON-empty (the directory must actually have committed content, not just an absence of complaints). If either check fails, REFUSE — "commit the change directory first, then re-run archive" for the first, "this directory has no content in git history — commit it first" for the second — do NOT move or delete.
   - `prune` additionally requires a confirmation that NAMES the deletion (e.g. the user selects "Permanently delete <name> — no archive copy will exist, git history is the archive"), SEPARATE from any routine "proceed anyway" confirmation used elsewhere in this flow (e.g. the merge-confirmation override in step 2.6) — one consent must never silently authorize the other. REFUSE outright in a non-interactive / dispatched context without a prior explicit override naming the deletion specifically.

   **`in-repo`** (the default; also the fallback for `external` when the payload carries no `archiveDir` — state explicitly that the archive fell back from `external`, and NEVER escalate a fallback to deletion):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "<planningHome.changesDir>/archive"
   ```
   Generate target name using current date: `YYYY-MM-DD-<change-name>`.
   - If the target already exists: Fail with error, suggest renaming the existing archive or using a different date.
   - Otherwise: Move `changeRoot` to the archive directory.
   ```bash
   mv "<changeRoot>" "<planningHome.changesDir>/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>"
   ```

   **`external`** (payload carries `archiveDir`): same date-prefix and collision rule as `in-repo`, targeting the resolved machine-home location instead:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "<archiveDir>"
   mv "<changeRoot>" "<archiveDir>/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>"
   ```

   **`prune`** (after the preconditions above pass):
   1. **Write the prune tombstone FIRST, before deleting anything** — this is the ONLY way a later archive invocation can recognize this change once its directory is gone (git history holds nothing for a pruned change, by design). Resolve the work directory (`workDir` from the status JSON fetched in step 2; if absent — the project has no machine identity yet — mint one via any CLI surface that mints on demand, e.g. `rasen instructions apply --change <name> --json`, then re-resolve `workDir` from that response). Append to `ship-log.md` there (creating it with a minimal `# Ship Log: <name>` header if it does not yet exist):
      ```markdown
      **Pruned:** true
      **Pruned at:** <timestamp>
      ```
      Use the literal token `Pruned:` — step 1.5b's scan (and every other prune writer: the CLI, bulk-archive, and ship.ts's in-ship branch) greps for exactly that token; a differently-worded marker silently defeats the tombstone. If no work directory can be resolved even after attempting to mint one, proceed with the deletion anyway (never block on this) and say so explicitly in the summary — a later archive invocation for this name will report "not found" instead of "pruned".
   2. Delete the change directory:
      ```bash
      rm -rf "<changeRoot>"
      ```
   No archive directory is created anywhere — git history is the archive. Skip archive-directory quality/summary steps and say so explicitly rather than silently omitting them.

   **Post-bookkeeping commit guidance:** for `external` and `prune`, direct a pathspec-scoped commit containing ONLY the synced specs and the change-directory removal — no archive-dir additions (there is nothing new under `changesDir/archive` to add). `git commit -- <path>` alone only picks up tracked deletions/modifications — a spec sync that CREATED a new capability directory (untracked) would be silently left out and the tree would NOT end clean, so `git add` the pathspec first. Every destination's commit message carries the ship cross-reference (`sha-cross-stamping` capability) — but its content must match what actually happened THIS run, never a fixed template:
   - **"specs synced" clause:** include it only when delta specs existed AND were synced this run (step 4). When there were no delta specs, or the user chose "Archive without syncing", DROP the clause entirely — `chore(rasen): archive <name>`, not a false claim of syncing.
   - **Ship suffix:** append `; ship <short-sha>` (or, with the specs clause dropped, `(ship <short-sha>)`) sourced from the ship log's recorded `Commit:` line (work directory, resolved in step 2) — omit the suffix entirely, never invent one, when the log records no `Commit:` (a never-shipped or spec-only change).
   - Four resulting forms: `chore(rasen): archive <name> (specs synced; ship <short-sha>)`, `chore(rasen): archive <name> (specs synced)`, `chore(rasen): archive <name> (ship <short-sha>)`, or plain `chore(rasen): archive <name>`.
   ```bash
   git add -- "<changeRoot>" "<specsDir>"
   git commit -m "chore(rasen): archive <name> (specs synced; ship <short-sha>)" -- "<changeRoot>" "<specsDir>"
   ```

   For `in-repo`, the archive-dir addition rides the commit as it does today — same conditional message form, no other change.

5.5. **Close the delivery chain (`sha-cross-stamping`)**

   Resolve the work directory the same way step 5's own prune tombstone write does — `workDir` from the status JSON fetched in step 2; if absent, mint one via any CLI surface that mints on demand (e.g. `rasen instructions apply --change <name> --json`), then re-resolve `workDir` from that response. Do NOT silently fall back to `changeRoot`: for `external`/`prune` that directory is about to move or be deleted by the bookkeeping above, and a fallback resolved there could target a path this very step is destroying.

   The common case (a machine-home `workDir` resolves) is unaffected by the move/delete — use that same path for both appends below, before and after the commit. The one edge case needing care is a STICKY-LEGACY ship-log already living inside `changeRoot` (child 2's Q3 rule: an existing file stays where it is rather than migrating) when no `workDir` can be resolved even after minting: for `in-repo`/`external`, that file moves WITH the directory in the `mv` above, so the follow-up append (made after the commit) must target the NEW location (`<planningHome.changesDir>/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/ship-log.md` or `<archiveDir>/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/ship-log.md`), never the pre-move `changeRoot` path — the same "never fall back to a path this workflow just destroyed" rule `ship.ts`'s own ship-log write uses under in-ship timing. For `prune`, a sticky log in `changeRoot` has nowhere to be redirected to once `rm -rf` runs — this step's FIRST append (below, before the commit) must happen no later than step 5's own tombstone write, at the same resolved location, so it is captured before deletion; there is no post-deletion recovery.

   Before the post-bookkeeping commit above is created, append an `## Archive` section to `ship-log.md` at the resolved location — create the file with a minimal `# Ship Log: <name>` header first if none exists (a never-shipped or legacy change has no prior log):

   ```markdown
   ## Archive
   **Date:** <timestamp>
   **Ship commit:** <sha>            (copied from this log's own recorded `Commit:` line — omit this line entirely, never invent one, when the log records no `Commit:`)
   **Outcome:** archived to <path> (in-repo/external) | pruned (prune)
   ```

   The ship-side section (everything above `## Archive`) is NEVER rewritten by this append. Once the post-bookkeeping commit is created, append one more line immediately after committing:
   ```markdown
   **Archive commit:** <sha>          (`git rev-parse HEAD` right after the commit above)
   ```
   so both ends of the chain live in the one file. (`prune`'s tombstone write earlier in step 5 already records `Pruned: true`/`Pruned at:` in the same ship-log — this section adds the SHA-bearing chain record alongside it, not instead of it.)

6. **Display summary**

   Show archive completion summary including:
   - Change name
   - Schema that was used
   - Destination (`in-repo` / `external` / `prune`) and, unless pruned, the archive location — note explicitly when `external` fell back to `in-repo`
   - Whether specs were synced (if applicable)
   - Ship SHA cross-reference, when recorded (the archive commit message and the ship-log's `## Archive` section)
   - Note about any warnings (incomplete artifacts/tasks)

**Output On Success**

```
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Destination:** in-repo | external | prune
**Archived to:** the archive path derived from `planningHome.changesDir`/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/ (external: the machine-home path instead; prune: omit this line — "Pruned: no archive copy, git history is the archive")
**Specs:** ✓ Synced to main specs (or "No delta specs" or "Sync skipped")

All artifacts complete. All tasks complete.
```

**Guardrails**
- Always prompt for change selection if not provided
- Use artifact graph (rasen status --json) for completion checking
- **Hard gates vs soft warnings (precedence).** REFUSE archive by default on the three HARD GATES — merge confirmation for a recorded `pr`-mode delivery (Step 2.6: an open or closed-unmerged PR, or an unverifiable merge state), a `VERIFY VERDICT: BLOCKED` verification report (Step 3.5), and incomplete tasks (Step 3): proceed only on an explicit blocker-naming override, and refuse outright non-interactively. The merge gate has TWO distinct proceed paths that must not be confused: the blocker-naming **override** applies ONLY to an OPEN PR (proceed despite a known-unmerged state); a SEPARATE **confirmation** path applies ONLY to an unverifiable merge state (the human's explicit assertion REPLACES the check, it does not override a known-bad one) — a closed-unmerged PR has NEITHER path and is refused outright. The "don't block archive on warnings — just inform and confirm" rule applies ONLY to SOFT warnings (incomplete non-task artifacts, unsynced delta specs, missing ship log, portfolio-deferred delivery); it does NOT cover the three hard gates.
- **Already-archived no-op (Step 1.5), every destination.** A change already found — in the in-repo `<changesDir>/archive/`, in the external `<machineHome>/archive/`, or via its ship-log tombstone (`Archived in ship:` / `Pruned:`) — is reported from that location or recorded outcome and never re-gated, re-synced, re-moved, or re-deleted. Detection happens BEFORE the status call, so a moved-or-deleted change directory never causes a hard failure. Step 2.5's `Archived in ship:`/`Pruned:`-present-but-not-caught-by-1.5 branches are defense-in-depth inconsistency checks, not the primary detection path.
- **Destructive-destination preconditions (Step 5).** `external` and `prune` bookkeeping REFUSE outright unless the change directory is BOTH clean (`git status --porcelain --ignored -- <changeRoot>` empty — plain `--porcelain` without `--ignored` is NOT enough, since gitignored content is invisible to it) AND tracked (`git ls-files -- <changeRoot>` non-empty) — uncommitted, untracked, or ignored-but-present content is not yet in git history, and destroying the only copy is never acceptable. `prune` additionally REFUSES without its own confirmation that NAMES the deletion — a SEPARATE consent from any other override in this flow (e.g. the merge-confirmation override never doubles as prune consent) — non-interactively without a prior explicit override naming the deletion specifically. A destination fallback (`external` → `in-repo` when unresolvable) MAY relocate; it must NEVER escalate to deletion.
- **Chain-record append (Step 5.5) is append-only.** The ship-side ship-log section is never rewritten; the ship commit SHA is a copied recorded fact (from the log's own `Commit:` line), never re-derived or invented — omit the ship reference entirely for a never-shipped change rather than fabricating one.
- Preserve .openspec.yaml when moving to archive (it moves with the directory)
- Show clear summary of what happened
- If sync is requested, use rasen-sync-specs approach (agent-driven)
- If delta specs exist, always run the sync assessment and show the combined summary before prompting
