## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
```

**Config (embedded at install time):**
- **Proactive:** `true` — if `false`, do not proactively suggest expert skills. Only invoke them when the user explicitly asks.
- **Repo mode:** `collaborative` — controls issue ownership behavior (see Repo Ownership Mode below).

## Canonical severity vocabulary

Findings from the generic expert skills (review, cso, qa, qa-only, benchmark, design-review) feed one canonical severity scale — the same scale the review→fix loop and the verify stage consume to decide clean vs. escalate. Classify against these four levels:

- **Blocker** — must not ship: wrong behavior on a common path, data loss or corruption, an exploitable security hole, a failing test or gate, or a required spec behavior missing.
- **Major** — should not ship without an explicit decision: wrong behavior on a plausible path, or a significant regression.
- **Minor** — ship-able friction or quality; recorded as accepted-known, never silently dropped.
- **Trivial** — cosmetic or a nit.

Each expert speaks a native scale; map it onto the canonical scale below. **Finding content overrides the native label where they disagree** — an item that names data loss, a security hole, or silent corruption maps UP regardless of the label its skill gave it (e.g. a review `INFORMATIONAL` item describing silent data corruption is Major, not Minor).

| Expert (native scale) | Blocker | Major | Minor | Trivial |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| review `CRITICAL` / `INFORMATIONAL` | `CRITICAL` naming data-loss / security / corruption / crash on a common path | other `CRITICAL` (correctness); `INFORMATIONAL` naming data-loss / security / silent corruption | `INFORMATIONAL` (default) | pure nit / style |
| cso `CRITICAL` / `HIGH` / `MEDIUM` (+ conf N/10) | `CRITICAL` | `HIGH` | `MEDIUM` | — (cso drops < MEDIUM by design) |
| qa / qa-only `critical` / `high` / `medium` / `low` / `cosmetic` | `critical` | `high` | `medium` / `low` | `cosmetic` |
| benchmark `REGRESSION` / `WARNING` / `OK` (+ Grade A–F) | `REGRESSION` crossing a hard budget (a FAIL row) | `REGRESSION` (timing / size) | `WARNING` | `OK`; grade-only deltas |
| design-review impact `high` / `medium` / `polish` (+ Grade A–F) | high-impact broken / unusable UI (rare) | high impact | medium | polish |
| codex `[P1]` / `[P2]` (display-only, not gate-consumed) | `[P1]` | `[P2]` | — | — |

In dispatched mode (see below) each expert self-maps and tags every finding it emits with a canonical severity in its report file, so the LEAD and the loop never have to infer a mapping.

## Dispatched vs standalone mode

The generic expert skills (review, cso, qa, qa-only, benchmark, design-review) run in one of two modes. Detect the mode from your own invocation — no flag is required:

- **Dispatched (report-only) mode** — your invocation instructs you to do a single unit of work, to not spawn subagents, and states that a LEAD owns orchestration (the signature every orchestrated dispatch carries). You are a role-isolated leaf reviewer worker.
- **Standalone mode** — a human invoked you directly (none of the above). Keep your full behavior as described in this skill.

If an explicit `MODE: dispatched (report-only)` token is present in your instructions, honor it; the self-trigger above is the fallback when the token is absent.

**In dispatched mode you MUST:**
- Apply **no** AUTO-FIX and make **no** code edits. Fix-class items are reported for the LEAD's triage to a non-author fixer, never applied by you.
- Issue **no** `AskUserQuestion`. There is no interactive user at a leaf worker; ASK-class items are reported as unresolved findings for the LEAD.
- Make **no** `git commit`. The LEAD / ship owns commits; concurrent commits on the shared index clobber each other.
- Spawn **no** subagents of your own. Independence comes from the LEAD's parallel reviewers and the mandatory non-author re-review, not from a leaf worker's own fan-out.
- Return classified findings and **write only the canonical `<skill>-report.md`** (review → `review-report.md`, cso → `cso-report.md`, qa and qa-only → `qa-report.md`, benchmark → `benchmark-report.md`, design-review → `design-review-report.md`) in the change's **work directory** — the `workDir` reported by `rasen status --change <name> --json` (or the dispatch prompt); fall back to the change directory when `workDir` is absent or the report already lives there (sticky-legacy) — each finding tagged with a canonical severity. Do NOT also write to the standalone `.rasen/*-reports/` or `~/.rasen/projects/` paths.

These dispatched-mode prohibitions **override** any contrary standalone instruction later in this skill (fix loops, batched questions, clean-tree gates, adversarial subagent dispatch, native report paths). Standalone mode retains all of that behavior.

**Denied-edit honesty.** If an Edit or Write you attempt is **denied** by an active edit boundary — a `/freeze` or `/guard` whose target is outside the allowed directory — the fix did NOT land. Report it as an un-applied finding, `[BLOCKED: freeze/guard] file:line — proposed fix`, never as `[AUTO-FIXED]`, and never silently drop it. The boundary hook wins over any Fix-First rule; do not claim a fix succeeded when it was refused. (Dispatched mode does no AUTO-FIX at all; this clause primarily governs the standalone fix loops.)

## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground (per the Dialogue Override):** State the project, the current branch (use the `_BRANCH` value printed by the preamble — NOT any branch from conversation history or gitStatus), and the current plan/task (1-2 sentences). This step follows the Dialogue Override's re-ground rule — restate at the START of a session or after a genuine long gap, NOT on every consecutive AskUserQuestion call in continuous back-and-forth. The "for every AskUserQuestion call" framing above does NOT require repeating the full project/branch/plan opener between consecutive replies (steps 2–4 apply every call; this re-ground is gap-gated).
2. **Simplify:** Explain the problem in plain English a smart 16-year-old could follow. No raw function names, no internal jargon, no implementation details. Use concrete examples and analogies. Say what it DOES, not what it's called.
3. **Recommend:** `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]` — always prefer the complete option over shortcuts. Include `Completeness: X/10` for each option **only when the decision weighs a shortcut against a complete implementation**; discussion-type or exploratory forks do NOT carry a Completeness score. Calibration (when it applies): 10 = complete implementation (all edge cases, full coverage), 7 = covers happy path but skips some edges, 3 = shortcut that defers significant work. If both options are 8+, pick the higher; if one is ≤5, flag it.
4. **Options:** Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...` — when an option involves effort, show both scales: `(human: ~X / CC: ~Y)`

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes and doesn't have the code open. If you'd need to read the source to understand your own explanation, it's too complex.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Dialogue Override

AskUserQuestion is a **decision tool, not a conversation tool.** Before every AskUserQuestion call, read the user's previous message. If it contains a question, a request to explain or discuss, or free-text that is not a clean selection of one of your options → **pause the question flow.** Answer in body prose — no lettered options, no `RECOMMENDATION`, no `Completeness` score — and keep discussing until the user explicitly signals to proceed. Then resume the phase exactly where you paused; never skip ahead.

- **Never answer and advance in the same turn.** Answer the question this turn; ask your next question only once the user signals they are ready.
- **A request for more dialogue is the opposite of a skip signal.** "Answer me first," "let's discuss," and repeated follow-up questions mean the user wants *more* conversation — they NEVER trigger a fast-forward, an escape hatch, or a jump to the next phase.
- **Re-ground only after a genuine long gap.** In continuous back-and-forth, do not repeat the template opener (project / branch / plan restatement) on every turn — it belongs at the start of a session or after the user has been away, not between consecutive replies.

## Repo Ownership Mode — See Something, Say Something

`Repo mode` from the preamble config tells you who owns issues in this repo:

- **`solo`** — One person does 80%+ of the work. They own everything. When you notice issues outside the current branch's changes (test failures, deprecation warnings, security advisories, linting errors, dead code, env problems), **investigate and offer to fix proactively**. The solo dev is the only person who will fix it. Default to action.
- **`collaborative`** — Multiple active contributors. When you notice issues outside the branch's changes, **flag them via AskUserQuestion** — it may be someone else's responsibility. Default to asking, not fixing.
- **`unknown`** — Treat as collaborative (safer default — ask before fixing).

**See Something, Say Something:** Whenever you notice something that looks wrong during ANY workflow step — not just test failures — flag it briefly. One sentence: what you noticed and its impact. In solo mode, follow up with "Want me to fix it?" In collaborative mode, just flag it and move on.

Never let a noticed issue silently pass. The whole point is proactive communication.

**Scope (dispatched leaf workers override this section):** every absolute above — `solo`'s "**investigate and offer to fix proactively**" / "**Default to action**", the "**ANY workflow step**" reach of See-Something-Say-Something, and "**Never let a noticed issue silently pass**" — is scoped to **interactive / standalone** sessions, where you can actually reach the user to offer a fix. When you are a **dispatched leaf worker** (a one-unit-of-work dispatch under the LEAD; see the dispatched-mode contract), this whole section is OVERRIDDEN: an out-of-scope issue you notice goes into your `DONE` **durable-findings** for the LEAD to triage — you do NOT investigate it, fix it, or ask the user about it (you cannot reach the user, and investigating breaks your one-unit-of-work isolation). Recording it in durable-findings IS "not letting it silently pass" — it is the dispatched-mode form of the same discipline. This is consistent with the dispatched-mode one-unit-of-work contract; it does NOT reopen the report-only dispatched contract.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — write a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file with this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| Verify | \`/rasen:verify\` | Implementation matches the change artifacts | 0 | — | — |
| Verify (enhanced) | \`/rasen:verify-enhanced\` | Adds code-review, security, and browser passes | 0 | — | — |
| Review cycle | \`/rasen:review-cycle\` | Iterate review → triage → fix until clean | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/rasen:review-cycle\` for the full review loop, or the individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

# Systematic Debugging

<!-- The feedback-loop-first phase, minimise step, ranked-falsifiable hypotheses, the "no correct seam is itself the finding" rule, and the HITL sidecar are adapted from mattpocock/skills (MIT, Copyright Matt Pocock). -->

## Iron Law

**NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.**

Fixing symptoms creates whack-a-mole debugging. Every fix that doesn't address root cause makes the next bug harder to find. Find the root cause, then fix it.

---

## Phase 1: Build a red-capable feedback loop

**This is the skill.** Everything downstream — bisection, hypothesis testing, instrumentation — just consumes a pass/fail signal that goes **red** on _this_ bug. Build that signal first. If you catch yourself reading code to form a theory before the signal exists, **stop** — jumping straight to a hypothesis is the exact failure this phase prevents.

1. **Capture the exact symptom.** Read the error messages, stack traces, and reproduction steps, and pin down the *user's* exact symptom — the specific error, wrong output, or slow timing — because that is what your loop must assert on. If context is missing, ask ONE question at a time via AskUserQuestion.

2. **Construct the loop.** Reach for a signal in roughly this order — earlier options are tighter:
   1. **Failing test** at whatever seam reaches the bug — unit, integration, e2e.
   2. **Curl / HTTP script** against a running dev server.
   3. **CLI invocation** with a fixture input, diffing stdout against a known-good snapshot.
   4. **Headless browser script** (Playwright / Puppeteer) driving the UI, asserting on DOM/console/network.
   5. **Replay a captured trace** — save a real request / payload / event log to disk, replay it through the code path in isolation.
   6. **Throwaway harness** — a minimal subset of the system (one service, mocked deps) that hits the bug path in a single call.
   7. **Property / fuzz loop** — for "sometimes wrong output", run 1000 random inputs and look for the failure mode.
   8. **Bisection harness** — if the bug appeared between two known states (commit, dataset, version), automate "boot at state X, check, repeat" for `git bisect run`.
   9. **Differential loop** — run the same input through old vs new (or two configs) and diff outputs.
   10. **HITL bash script** (last resort) — if a human must click, drive _them_ with `scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh` so the loop stays structured; captured output feeds back to you.

3. **Tighten the loop.** Treat it as a product: make it **faster** (cache setup, skip unrelated init, narrow test scope), the signal **sharper** (assert the specific symptom, not "didn't crash"), and **more deterministic** (pin time, seed RNG, isolate filesystem, freeze network). A 2-second deterministic loop is a debugging superpower; a 30-second flaky one is barely better than none.

4. **Non-deterministic bugs:** the goal is a **higher reproduction rate**, not a clean repro. Loop the trigger 100×, parallelise, add stress, narrow timing windows, inject sleeps. A 50%-flake bug is debuggable; 1% is not — keep raising the rate until it is.

5. **If you genuinely cannot build a loop:** stop and say so explicitly. List what you tried and ask the user for (a) access to an environment that reproduces it, (b) a captured artifact (HAR file, log dump, core dump, timestamped recording), or (c) permission to add temporary instrumentation. Do **not** proceed to hypotheses without a loop.

**Completion criterion — the hard gate.** You can name **one command** — a test invocation, a curl, a script path — that you have **already run at least once** (paste the invocation and its output), and that is:

- [ ] **Red-capable** — drives the actual bug code path and asserts the **user's exact symptom**, so it goes red on this bug and green once fixed. Not "runs without erroring" — it must catch *this* bug.
- [ ] **Deterministic** — same verdict every run (flaky bugs: a pinned, high reproduction rate, per above).
- [ ] **Fast** — seconds, not minutes.
- [ ] **Agent-runnable** — you can run it unattended; a human in the loop only via `scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh`.

**No red-capable command → no Phase 4 hypotheses.**

---

## Phase 2: Reproduce + minimise

Run the loop. Watch it go red — the bug appears. Confirm:

- [ ] The failure is the one the **user** described — not a different failure nearby. Wrong bug = wrong fix.
- [ ] It reproduces across multiple runs (or, for non-deterministic bugs, at a high enough rate to debug against).

**Minimise:** once it's red, shrink the repro to the **smallest scenario that still goes red**. Cut inputs, callers, config, data, and steps **one at a time**, re-running the loop after each cut — keep only what's load-bearing for the failure. Done when removing any remaining element makes the loop go green. A minimal repro shrinks the hypothesis space in Phase 4 (fewer moving parts to suspect) and becomes the clean regression test in Phase 6.

Do not proceed until you have reproduced **and** minimised.

---

## Scope Lock

With a minimised repro in hand you know the affected module — lock edits to it to prevent scope creep.

```bash
[ -x "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../freeze/bin/check-freeze.sh" ] && echo "FREEZE_AVAILABLE" || echo "FREEZE_UNAVAILABLE"
```

**If FREEZE_AVAILABLE:** Identify the narrowest directory containing the affected files. Write it to the freeze state file:

```bash
STATE_DIR="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA:-$HOME/.gstack}"
mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR"
echo "<detected-directory>/" > "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt"
echo "Debug scope locked to: <detected-directory>/"
```

Substitute `<detected-directory>` with the actual directory path (e.g., `src/auth/`). Tell the user: "Edits restricted to `<dir>/` for this debug session. This prevents changes to unrelated code. Run `/unfreeze` to remove the restriction."

If the bug spans the entire repo or the scope is genuinely unclear, skip the lock and note why.

**If FREEZE_UNAVAILABLE:** Skip scope lock. Edits are unrestricted.

---

## Phase 3: Pattern Analysis

Check if this bug matches a known pattern:

| Pattern | Signature | Where to look |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Race condition | Intermittent, timing-dependent | Concurrent access to shared state |
| Nil/null propagation | NoMethodError, TypeError | Missing guards on optional values |
| State corruption | Inconsistent data, partial updates | Transactions, callbacks, hooks |
| Integration failure | Timeout, unexpected response | External API calls, service boundaries |
| Configuration drift | Works locally, fails in staging/prod | Env vars, feature flags, DB state |
| Stale cache | Shows old data, fixes on cache clear | Redis, CDN, browser cache, Turbo |

Also check:
- `git log --oneline -20 -- <affected-files>` — **was this working before?** A regression means the root cause is in the diff.
- `TODOS.md` for related known issues
- `git log` for prior fixes in the same area — **recurring bugs in the same files are an architectural smell**, not a coincidence

**External pattern search:** If the bug doesn't match a known pattern above, WebSearch for:
- "{framework} {generic error type}" — **sanitize first:** strip hostnames, IPs, file paths, SQL, customer data. Search the error category, not the raw message.
- "{library} {component} known issues"

If WebSearch is unavailable, skip this search and proceed with hypothesis testing. If a documented solution or known dependency bug surfaces, present it as a candidate hypothesis in Phase 4.

---

## Phase 4: Hypothesis Testing

Generate **3–5 ranked hypotheses** before testing any of them — single-hypothesis generation anchors on the first plausible idea. Each must be **falsifiable**: state the prediction it makes.

> Format: "If <X> is the cause, then <changing Y> makes the bug disappear / <changing Z> makes it worse."

If you cannot state the prediction, the hypothesis is a vibe — discard or sharpen it. **Show the ranked list to the user before testing** — they often re-rank it instantly ("we just deployed a change to #3") or know hypotheses already ruled out. Cheap checkpoint, big time saver. Don't block on it — proceed with your ranking if the user is AFK. Then test the top hypothesis; Phase 5 instruments it.

1. **If the hypothesis is wrong:** Before forming the next, consider searching for the error. **Sanitize first** — strip hostnames, IPs, file paths, SQL fragments, customer identifiers, and any internal/proprietary data from the error message. Search only the generic error type and framework context: "{component} {sanitized error type} {framework version}". If the message is too specific to sanitize safely, or WebSearch is unavailable, skip. Then gather more evidence — do not guess.

2. **3-strike rule:** If 3 hypotheses fail, **STOP**. Use AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   3 hypotheses tested, none match. This may be an architectural issue
   rather than a simple bug.

   A) Continue investigating — I have a new hypothesis: [describe]
   B) Escalate for human review — this needs someone who knows the system
   C) Add logging and wait — instrument the area and catch it next time
   ```

**Red flags** — if you see any of these, slow down:
- "Quick fix for now" — there is no "for now." Fix it right or escalate.
- Proposing a fix before tracing data flow — you're guessing.
- Each fix reveals a new problem elsewhere — wrong layer, not wrong code.

---

## Phase 5: Instrument

Each probe must map to a specific prediction from Phase 4. **Change one variable at a time.**

1. **Debugger / REPL inspection** if the env supports it — one breakpoint beats ten logs.
2. **Targeted logs** at the boundaries that distinguish hypotheses.
3. Never "log everything and grep".

**Tag every debug log** with a unique prefix, e.g. `[DEBUG-a4f2]`, so cleanup is a single grep — untagged logs survive, tagged logs die.

**Perf branch.** For performance regressions, logs are usually wrong. Instead establish a baseline measurement (timing harness, `performance.now()`, profiler, query plan), then bisect. Measure first, fix second.

---

## Phase 6: Fix + regression test

Once root cause is confirmed:

1. **Write the regression test _before_ the fix — but only if a correct seam exists.** A correct seam exercises the **real bug pattern** as it occurs at the call site. If the only available seam is too shallow (a single-caller test when the bug needs multiple callers, a unit test that can't replicate the triggering chain), a test there gives false confidence. **If no correct seam exists, that itself is the finding** — note it; the architecture is preventing the bug from being locked down, and Phase 7 flags it. If a correct seam exists, turn the minimised repro into a failing test at that seam and watch it fail.

2. **Fix the root cause, not the symptom.** The smallest change that eliminates the actual problem.

3. **Minimal diff:** fewest files touched, fewest lines changed. Resist the urge to refactor adjacent code.

4. **Watch the regression test pass**, then re-run the Phase 1 feedback loop against the original (un-minimised) scenario.

5. **Run the full test suite.** Paste the output. No regressions allowed.

6. **If the fix touches >5 files:** Use AskUserQuestion to flag the blast radius:
   ```
   This fix touches N files. That's a large blast radius for a bug fix.
   A) Proceed — the root cause genuinely spans these files
   B) Split — fix the critical path now, defer the rest
   C) Rethink — maybe there's a more targeted approach
   ```

---

## Phase 7: Verification & Report

**Fresh verification:** Reproduce the original bug scenario by re-running the Phase 1 loop and confirm it's fixed. This is not optional. Run the test suite and paste the output.

Before declaring done:
- [ ] Original repro no longer reproduces (Phase 1 loop is green)
- [ ] Regression test passes (or the absence of a correct seam is documented)
- [ ] All `[DEBUG-...]` instrumentation removed (`grep` the prefix)
- [ ] Throwaway harnesses deleted or moved to a clearly-marked debug location

Output a structured debug report:
```
DEBUG REPORT
════════════════════════════════════════
Symptom:         [what the user observed]
Root cause:      [what was actually wrong]
Fix:             [what was changed, with file:line references]
Evidence:        [test output, reproduction attempt showing fix works]
Regression test: [file:line of the new test, or documented absence of a correct seam]
Related:         [TODOS.md items, prior bugs in same area, architectural notes]
Status:          DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED
════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Post-mortem — what would have prevented this bug?** State the hypothesis that turned out correct in the commit / PR message so the next debugger learns. If the answer involves architectural change (no good test seam, tangled callers, hidden coupling), **flag the architectural finding** with the specifics — make that recommendation *after* the fix is in, when you know more than you did at the start.

---

## Important Rules

- **3+ failed fix attempts → STOP and question the architecture.** Wrong architecture, not failed hypothesis.
- **No red-capable feedback loop → no hypotheses.** Building the loop (Phase 1) precedes every theory.
- **Never apply a fix you cannot verify.** If you can't reproduce and confirm, don't ship it.
- **Never say "this should fix it."** Verify and prove it. Run the tests.
- **If fix touches >5 files → AskUserQuestion** about blast radius before proceeding.
- **Completion status:**
  - DONE — root cause found, fix applied, regression test written (or seam absence documented), all tests pass
  - DONE_WITH_CONCERNS — fixed but cannot fully verify (e.g., intermittent bug, requires staging)
  - BLOCKED — root cause unclear after investigation, escalated

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone Rasen repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `rasen store list --json` to discover registered store ids and project ids (the `type` field on each entry), then pass `--store <id>` (or `--project <id>` for a project registered via `store add-project`) on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, and the top-level `context`). The `rasen pipeline` inspection group (`pipeline list`, `pipeline show`, `pipeline agents`, `pipeline classify`, `pipeline resume`) also accepts `--store <id>`/`--project <id>` and resolves its root exactly like `validate` — in a store- or project-scoped run you MUST thread the SAME flag onto `pipeline resume <change>` so it reads the change's run-state from that root's change directory, not the cwd. `--store` and `--project` are mutually exclusive on one invocation — pass only one. A store and a project may share the same id (they are separate namespaces); a bare id with neither flag always means the store namespace. Commands outside those two groups do not take either flag — in particular `rasen agent context` (the agent-runtime probe) is NOT the same command as the top-level `rasen context` and does NOT accept `--store`/`--project`; do not paste either flag onto it. Hints printed by commands already carry the right flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store or project flag, commands act on the nearest local `rasen/` root.
